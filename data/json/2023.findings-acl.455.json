  "abstract": "Despite becoming a prevailing paradigm for organizing knowledge, most knowledge graphs (KGs) suffer from the low-resource issue due to the deficiency of data sources. The enrichment of KGs by automatic knowledge graph completion is impeded by the intrinsic long-tail property of KGs. In spite of their prosperity, existing few-shot learning-based models have difficulty alleviating the impact of the long-tail issue on low-resource KGs because of the lack of training tasks. To tackle the challenging long-tail issue on low-resource KG completion, in this paper, we propose a novel few-shot low-resource knowledge graph completion framework, which is composed of three components, i.e., few-shot learner, task generator, and task selector. The key idea is to generate and then select the beneficial few-shot tasks that complement the current tasks and enable the optimization of the few-shot learner using the selected few-shot tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on several real-world knowledge graphs validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",
