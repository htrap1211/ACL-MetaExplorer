  "abstract": "Graph-based techniques have gained traction for representing and analyzing data in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Knowledge graph-based language representation models have shown promising results in leveraging domain-specific knowledge for NLP tasks, particularly in the biomedical NLP field. However, such models have limitations, including knowledge noise and neglect of contextual relationships, leading to potential semantic errors and reduced accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes two novel methods. The first method combines knowledge graph-based language model with nearest-neighbor models to incorporate semantic and category information from neighboring instances. The second method involves integrating knowledge graph-based language model with graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage feature information from neighboring nodes in the graph. Experiments on relation extraction (RE) and classification tasks in English and Chinese language datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements with both methods, highlighting their potential for enhancing the performance of language models and improving NLP applications in the biomedical domain.",
