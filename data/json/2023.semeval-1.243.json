  "abstract": "This paper describes our system submitted to SemEval-2023 Task 5: Clickbait Spoiling. We work on spoiler generation of the subtask 2 and develop a system which comprises two parts: 1) simple seq2seq spoiler generation and 2) post-hoc model ensembling. Using this simple method, we address the challenge of generating multipart spoiler. In the test set, our submitted system outperformed the baseline by a large margin (approximately 10 points above on the BLEU score) for mixed types of spoilers. We also found that our system successfully handled the challenge of the multipart spoiler, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.",
