  "abstract": "We describe the methods and results of our submission to the 9th Social Media Mining for Health Research and Applications (SMM4H) 2024 shared tasks 4 and 5. Task 4 involved extracting the clinical and social impacts of non-medical substance use and task 5 focused on the binary classification of tweets reporting childrenâ€™s medical disorders. We employed encoder language models and their ensembles, achieving the top score on task 4 and a high score for task 5.",
