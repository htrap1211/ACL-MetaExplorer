  "abstract": "This paper investigates the optimization of propaganda technique detection in Arabic text, including tweets & news paragraphs, from ArAIEval shared task 1. Our approach involves fine-tuning the AraBERT v2 model with a neural network classifier for sequence tagging.Experimental results show relying on the first token of the word for technique prediction produces the best performance. In addition, incorporating genre information as a feature further enhances the modelâ€™s performance. Our system achieved a score of 25.41, placing us 4th on the leaderboard. Subsequent post-submission improvements further raised our score to 26.68.",
