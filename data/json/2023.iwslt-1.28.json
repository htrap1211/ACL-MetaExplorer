  "abstract": "We describe the Johns Hopkins ACL 60-60 Speech Translation systems submitted to the IWSLT 2023 Multilingual track, where we were tasked to translate ACL presentations from English into 10 languages. We developed cascaded speech translation systems for both the constrained and unconstrained subtracks. Our systems make use of pre-trained models as well as domain-specific corpora for this highly technical evaluation-only task. We find that the specific technical domain which ACL presentations fall into presents a unique challenge for both ASR and MT, and we present an error analysis and an ACL-specific corpus we produced to enable further work in this area.",
