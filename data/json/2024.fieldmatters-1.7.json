  "abstract": "This study evaluates the impact of speech enhancement (SE) techniques on linguistic research, focusing on their ability to maintain essential acoustic characteristics in enhanced audio without introducing significant artifacts. Through a sociophonetic analysis of Peninsular and Peruvian Spanish speakers, using both original and enhanced recordings, we demonstrate that SE effectively preserves critical speech nuances such as voicing and vowel quality. This supports the use of SE in improving the quality of speech samples. This study marks an initial effort to assess SEâ€™s reliability in language studies and proposes a methodology for enhancing low-quality audio corpora of under-resourced languages.",
