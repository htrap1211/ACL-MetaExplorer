  "abstract": "In developing countries like India, doctors and healthcare professionals working in public health spend significant time answering health queries that are fact-based and repetitive. Therefore, we propose an automated way to answer maternal and child health-related queries. A database of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and their corresponding answers generated by experts is curated from rural health workers and young mothers. We develop a Hindi chatbot that identifies k relevant Question and Answer (QnA) pairs from the database in response to a healthcare query (q) written in Devnagri script or Hindi-English (Hinglish) code-mixed script. The curated database covers 80% of all the queries that a user of our study is likely to ask. We experimented with (i) rule-based methods, (ii) sentence embeddings, and (iii) a paraphrasing classifier, to calculate the q-Q similarity. We observed that paraphrasing classifier gives the best result when trained first on an open-domain text and then on the healthcare domain. Our chatbot uses an ensemble of all three approaches. We observed that if a given q can be answered using the database, then our chatbot can provide at least one relevant QnA pair among its top three suggestions for up to 70% of the queries.",
