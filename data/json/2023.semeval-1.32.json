  "abstract": "To improve the ability of language models to handle Natural Language Processing(NLP) tasks and intermediate step of pre-training has recently beenintroduced. In this setup, one takes a pre-trained language model, trains it ona (set of) NLP dataset(s), and then finetunes it for a target task. It isknown that the selection of relevant transfer tasks is important, but recentlysome work has shown substantial performance gains by doing intermediatetraining on a very large set of datasets. Most previous work uses generativelanguage models or only focuses on one or a couple of tasks and uses acarefully curated setup. We compare intermediate training with one or manytasks in a setup where the choice of datasets is more arbitrary; we use allSemEval 2023 text-based tasks. We reach performance improvements for most taskswhen using intermediate training. Gains are higher when doing intermediatetraining on single tasks than all tasks if the right transfer taskis identified. Dataset smoothing and heterogeneous batching did not lead torobust gains in our setup.",
