  "abstract": "This paper introduces a data augmentation technique for the task of detecting human values. Our approach involves generating additional examples using metadata that describes the labels in the datasets. We evaluated the effectiveness of our method by fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa models on our augmented dataset and comparing their F1 -scores to those of the non-augmented dataset. We obtained competitive results on both the Main test set and the Nahj al-Balagha test set, ranking 14th and 7th respectively among the participants. We also demonstrate that by incorporating our augmentation technique, the classification performance of BERT and RoBERTa is improved, resulting in an increase of up to 10.1% in their F1-score.",
