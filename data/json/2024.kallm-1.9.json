  "abstract": "This article argues that digital educational content should be structured as knowledge graphs (KGs). Unlike traditional repositories such as Moodle, a KG offers a more flexible representation of the relationships between concepts, facilitating intuitive navigation and discovery of connections. In addition, it integrates effectively with Large Language Models, enhancing personalized explanations, answers, and recommendations. This article studies different proposals based on semantics and knowledge modelling to determine the most appropriate ways to strengthen intelligent educational technologies.",
