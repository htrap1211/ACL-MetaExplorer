  "abstract": "We tackle the problem of monolingual phrase alignment conforming to syntactic structures. The existing method formalises the problem as unordered tree mapping; hence, the alignment quality is easily affected by syntactic ambiguities. We address this problem by expanding the method to align parse forests rather than 1-best trees, where syntactic structures and phrase alignment are simultaneously identified. The proposed method achieves efficient alignment by mapping forests on a packed structure. The experimental results indicated that our method improves the phrase alignment quality of the state-of-the-art method by aligning forests rather than 1-best trees.",
