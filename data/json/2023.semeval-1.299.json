  "abstract": "The human values expressed in argumentative texts can provide valuable insights into the culture of a society. They can be helpful in various applications such as value-based profiling and ethical analysis. However, one of the first steps in achieving this goal is to detect the category of human value from an argument accurately. This task is challenging due to the lack of data and the need for philosophical inference. It also can be challenging for humans to classify arguments according to their underlying human values. This paper elaborates on our model for the SemEval 2023 Task 4 on human value detection. We propose a class-token attention-based model and evaluate it against baseline models, including finetuned BERT language model and a keyword-based approach.",
