  "abstract": "Despite significant advances in Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), much work in this field has been carried out with a focus on verbal predicates, with the research on nominal SRL lagging behind. In many contexts, however, nominal predicates are often as informative as verbal ones, thus needing proper treatment. In this paper we aim to fill this gap and make nominal SRL a first-class citizen. We introduce a novel approach to create the first large-scale, high-quality inventory of nominal predicates and organize them into semantically-coherent frames. Although automatically created, NounAtlas – our frame inventory – is subsequently fully validated. We then put forward a technique to generate silver training data for nominal SRL and show that a state-of-the-art SRL model can achieve good performance. Interestingly, thanks to our design choices which enable seamless integration of our predicate inventory with its verbal counterpart, we can mix verbal and nominal data and perform robust SRL on both types of predicates.",
