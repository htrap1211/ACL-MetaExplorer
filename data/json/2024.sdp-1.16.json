  "abstract": "This paper explores the initial steps towards extracting information about theorems and proofs from scholarly documents to build a knowledge base of interlinked results. Specifically, we consider two main tasks: extracting results and their proofs from the PDFs of scientific articles and establishing which results are used in the proofs of others across the scientific literature. We discuss the problem statement, methodologies, and preliminary findings employed in both phases of our approach, highlighting the challenges faced.",
