  "abstract": "Although food consumption represents a sub- stantial global source of greenhouse gas emis- sions, assessing the environmental impact of off-the-shelf products remains challenging. Currently, this information is often unavailable, hindering informed consumer decisions when grocery shopping. The present work introduces a new set of models called LEAF, which stands for Linguistic Environmental Analysis of Food Products. LEAF models predict the life-cycle environmental impact of food products based on their name. It is shown that LEAF models can accurately predict the environmental im- pact based on just the product name in a multi- lingual setting, greatly outperforming zero-shot classification methods. Models of varying sizes and capabilities are released, along with the code and dataset to fully reproduce the study.",
