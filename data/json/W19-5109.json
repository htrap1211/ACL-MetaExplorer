  "abstract": "The paper presents the characteristics of the predominant types of MultiWord expressions (MWEs) in the BulTreeBank WordNet â€“ BTB-WN. Their distribution in BTB-WN is discussed with respect to the overall hierarchical organization of the lexical resource. Also, a catena-based modeling is proposed for handling the issues of lexical semantics of MWEs.",
