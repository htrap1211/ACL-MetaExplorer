  "abstract": "Audio-visual text generation aims to understand multi-modality contents and translate them into texts. Although various transfer learning techniques of text generation have been proposed, they focused on uni-modal analysis (e.g. text-to-text, visual-to-text) and lack consideration of multi-modal content and cross-modal relation. Motivated by the fact that humans can recognize the timbre of the same low-level concepts (e.g., footstep, rainfall, and laughing), even in different visual conditions, we aim to mitigate the domain discrepancies by audio-visual correlation. In this paper, we propose a novel Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation framework, named TAVT, which consists of two key components: Audio-Visual Meta-Mapper (AVMM) and Dual Counterfactual Contrastive Learning (DCCL). (1) AVMM first introduces a universal auditory semantic space and drifts the domain-invariant low-level concepts into visual prefixes. Then the reconstruct-based learning encourages the AVMM to learn “which pixels belong to the same sound” and achieve audio-enhanced visual prefix. The well-trained AVMM can be further applied to uni-modal setting. (2) Furthermore, DCCL leverages the destructive counterfactual transformations to provide cross-modal constraints for AVMM from the perspective of feature distribution and text generation. (3) The experimental results show that TAVT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across multiple domains (cross-datasets, cross-categories) and various modal settings (uni-modal, multi-modal).",
