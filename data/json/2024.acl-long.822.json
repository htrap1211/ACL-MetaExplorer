  "abstract": "Framing studies how individuals and societies make sense of the world, by communicating or representing complex issues through schema of interpretation. The framing of information in the mass media influences our interpretation of facts and corresponding decisions, so detecting and analysing it is essential to understand biases in the information we consume. Despite that, framing is still mostly examined manually, on a case-by-case basis, while existing large-scale automatic analyses using NLP methods are not mature enough to solve this task. In this survey we show that despite the growing interest to framing in NLP its current approaches do not capture those aspects which allow to frame, rather than simply convey, the message. To this end, we bring together definitions of frames and framing adopted in different disciplines; examine cognitive, linguistic, and communicative aspects a frame contains beyond its topical content. We survey recent work on computational frame detection, and discuss how framing aspects and frame definitions are (or should) be reflected in NLP approaches.",
