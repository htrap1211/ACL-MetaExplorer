  "abstract": "Diachronic Word Sense Induction (DWSI) is the task of inducing the temporal representations of a word meaning from the context, as a set of senses and their prevalence over time. We introduce two new models for DWSI, based on topic modelling techniques: one is based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP), a nonparametric model; the other is based on the Dynamic Embedded Topic Model (DETM), a recent dynamic neural model. We evaluate these models against two state of the art DWSI models, using a time-stamped labelled dataset from the biomedical domain. We demonstrate that the two proposed models perform better than the state of the art. In particular, the HDP-based model drastically outperforms all the other models, including the dynamic neural model.",
