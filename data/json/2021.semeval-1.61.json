  "abstract": "In this work, we describe our system submission to the SemEval 2021 Task 11: NLP Contribution Graph Challenge. We attempt all the three sub-tasks in the challenge and report our results. Subtask 1 aims to identify the contributing sentences in a given publication. Subtask 2 follows from Subtask 1 to extract the scientific term and predicate phrases from the identified contributing sentences. The final Subtask 3 entails extractingtriples(subject, predicate, object) from the phrases and categorizing them under one or more defined information units. With the NLPContributionGraph Shared Task, the organizers formalized the building of a scholarly contributions-focused graph over NLP scholarly articles as an automated task. Our approaches include a BERT-based classification model for identifying the contributing sentences in a research publication, a rule-based dependency parsing for phrase extraction, followed by a CNN-based model for information units classification, and a set of rules for triples extraction. The quantitative results show that we obtain the 5th, 5th, and 7th rank respectively in three evaluation phases. We make our codes available athttps://github.com/HardikArora17/SemEval-2021-INNOVATORS.",
