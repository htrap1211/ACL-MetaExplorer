  "abstract": "This paper presents my submission to Track 1 of the 2023 SIGMORPHON shared task on interlinear glossed text (IGT). There are a wide amount of techniques for building and training IGT models (see Moeller and Hulden, 2018; McMillan-Major, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020). I describe my ensembled sequence-to-sequence approach, perform experiments, and share my submissionâ€™s test-set accuracy. I also discuss future areas of research in low-resource token classification methods for IGT.",
