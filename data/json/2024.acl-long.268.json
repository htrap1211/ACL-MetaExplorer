  "abstract": "Since the remarkable generation performance of large language models raised ethical and legal concerns, approaches to detect machine-generated text by embedding watermarks are being developed.However, we discover that the existing works fail to function appropriately in code generation tasks due to the taskâ€™s nature of having low entropy.Extending a logit-modifying watermark method, we propose Selective WatErmarking via Entropy Thresholding (SWEET), which enhances detection ability and mitigates code quality degeneration by removing low-entropy segments at generating and detecting watermarks.Our experiments show that SWEET significantly improves code quality preservation while outperforming all baselines, including post-hoc detection methods, in detecting machine-generated code text.Our code is available inhttps://github.com/hongcheki/sweet-watermark.",
