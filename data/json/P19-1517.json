  "abstract": "An arithmetic word problem typically includes a textual description containing several constant quantities. The key to solving the problem is to reveal the underlying mathematical relations (such as addition and subtraction) among quantities, and then generate equations to find solutions. This work presents a novel approach,Quantity Tagger, that automatically discovers such hidden relations by tagging each quantity with asigncorresponding to one type of mathematical operation. For each quantity, we assume there exists a latent, variable-sizedquantity spansurrounding the quantity token in the text, which conveys information useful for determining its sign. Empirical results show that our method achieves 5 and 8 points of accuracy gains on two datasets respectively, compared to prior approaches.",
