  "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) has shown great potential for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) detection, particularly due to the adverse effect of AD on spontaneous speech. The current body of literature has directed attention toward context-based models, especially Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERTs), owing to their exceptional abilities to integrate contextual information in a wide range of NLP tasks. This comes at the cost of added model opacity and computational requirements. Taking this into consideration, we propose a Word2Vec-based model for AD detection in 108 age- and sex-matched participants who were asked to describe the Cookie Theft picture. We also investigate the effectiveness of our model by fine-tuning BERT-based sequence classification models, as well as incorporating linguistic features. Our results demonstrate that our lightweight and easy-to-implement model outperforms some of the state-of-the-art models available in the literature, as well as BERT models.",
