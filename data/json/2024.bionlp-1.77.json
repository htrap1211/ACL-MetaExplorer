  "abstract": "In this paper, we present our approach to the BioLaySumm 2024 Shared Task on Lay Sum- marization of Biomedical Research Articles at BioNLP workshop 2024. The task aims to generate lay summaries from the abstract and main texts of biomedical research articles, making them understandable to lay audiences. We used some preprocessing techniques and finetuned FLAN-T5 models for the summarization task. Our method achieved an AlignScore of 0.9914 and a SummaC metric score of 0.944.",
