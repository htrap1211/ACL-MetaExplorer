  "abstract": "Sexism is a growing online problem. It harms women who are targeted and makes online spaces inaccessible and unwelcoming. In this paper, we present our approach for Task A of SemEval-2023 Task 10: Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS), which aims to perform binary sexism detection on textual content. To solve this task, we fine-tune the pre-trained model based on several popular natural language processing methods to improve the generalization ability in the face of different data. According to the experimental results, the effective combination of multiple methods enables our approach to achieve excellent performance gains.",
