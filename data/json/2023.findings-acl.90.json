  "abstract": "Much work has been done to improve persona consistency by finetuning a pretrained dialogue model on high-quality human-annoated persona datasets. However, these methods still face the challenges of high cost and poor scalability. To this end, we propose a simple-yet-effective approach to significantly improve zero-shot persona consistency via in-context learning. Specifically, we first pre-train a persona-augmented dialogue generation model and then utilize in-context prompting mechanism to realize zero-shot persona customization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can dramatically improve persona consistency without compromising coherence and informativeness in zero-shot settings.",
