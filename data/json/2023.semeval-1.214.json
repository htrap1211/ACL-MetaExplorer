  "abstract": "Nowadays, persuasive messages are more and more frequent in social networks, which generates great concern in several communities, given that persuasion seeks to guide others towards the adoption of ideas, attitudes or actions that they consider to be beneficial to themselves. The efficient detection of news genre categories, detection of framing and detection of persuasion techniques requires several scientific disciplines, such as computational linguistics and sociology. Here we illustrate how we use lexical features given a news article, determine whether it is an opinion piece, aims to report factual news, or is satire. This paper presents a novel strategy for news based on Lexical Weirdness. The results are part of our participation in subtasks 1 and 2 in SemEval 2023 Task 3.",
