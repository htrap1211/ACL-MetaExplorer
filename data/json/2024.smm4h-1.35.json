  "abstract": "The goal of Social Media Mining for Health (#SMM4H) 2024 Task 7 was to train a machine learning model that is able to distinguish between annotations made by humans and those made by a Large Language Model (LLM). The dataset consisted of tweets originating from #SMM4H 2023 Task 3, wherein the objective was to extract COVID-19 symptoms in Latin-American Spanish tweets. Due to the lack of additional annotated tweets for classification, we reframed the task using the available tweets and their corresponding human or machine annotator labels to explore differences between the two subsets of tweets. We conducted an exploratory data analysis and trained a BERT-based classifier to identify sampling biases between the two subsets. The exploratory data analysis found no significant differences between the samples and our best classifier achieved a precision of 0.52 and a recall of 0.51, indicating near-random performance. This confirms the lack of sampling biases between the two sets of tweets and is thus a valid dataset for a task designed to assess the authorship of annotations by humans versus machines.",
