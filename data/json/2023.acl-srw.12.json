  "abstract": "This study proposes a new multimodal neural machine translation (MNMT) model using synthetic images transformed by a latent diffusion model. MNMT translates a source language sentence based on its related image, but the image usually contains noisy information that are not relevant to the source language sentence. Our proposed method first generates a synthetic image corresponding to the content of the source language sentence by using a latent diffusion model and then performs translation based on the synthetic image. The experiments on the English-German translation tasks using the Multi30k dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
