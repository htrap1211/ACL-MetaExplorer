  "abstract": "We study the problem of semi-supervised question answeringâ€”utilizing unlabeled text to boost the performance of question answering models. We propose a novel training framework, theGenerative Domain-Adaptive Nets. In this framework, we train a generative model to generate questions based on the unlabeled text, and combine model-generated questions with human-generated questions for training question answering models. We develop novel domain adaptation algorithms, based on reinforcement learning, to alleviate the discrepancy between the model-generated data distribution and the human-generated data distribution. Experiments show that our proposed framework obtains substantial improvement from unlabeled text.",
