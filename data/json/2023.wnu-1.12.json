  "abstract": "Understanding the settings of a given story has long been viewed as an essential component of understanding the story at large. This significance is not only underscored in academic literary analysis but also in kindergarten education. However, despite this significance, it has received relatively little attention regarding computational analyses of stories. This paper presents a dataset of 2,302 time period setting labeled works and 6,991 location setting labeled works. This dataset aims to help with Cultural Analytics of literary works but may also aid in time-period-related questions within literary Q\\&amp;A systems.",
