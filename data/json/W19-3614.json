  "abstract": "In this paper, we present an effort to generate a joint Urdu, Roman Urdu and English trilingual lexicon using automated methods. We make a case for using statistical machine translation approaches and parallel corpora for dictionary creation. To this purpose, we use word alignment tools on the corpus and evaluate translations using human evaluators. Despite different writing script and considerable noise in the corpus our results show promise with over 85% accuracy of Roman Urdu–Urdu and 45% English–Urdu pairs.",
