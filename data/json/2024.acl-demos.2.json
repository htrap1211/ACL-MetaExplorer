  "abstract": "We present OpenVNA, an open-source framework designed for analyzing the behavior of multimodal language understanding systems under noisy conditions. OpenVNA serves as an intuitive toolkit tailored for researchers, facilitating convenience batch-level robustness evaluation and on-the-fly instance-level demonstration. It primarily features a benchmark Python library for assessing global model robustness, offering high flexibility and extensibility, thereby enabling customization with user-defined noise types and models. Additionally, a GUI-based interface has been developed to intuitively analyze local model behavior. In this paper, we delineate the design principles and utilization of the created library and GUI-based web platform. Currently, OpenVNA is publicly accessible athttps://github.com/thuiar/OpenVNA, with a demonstration video available athttps://youtu.be/0Z9cW7RGct4.",
