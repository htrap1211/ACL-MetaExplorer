  "abstract": "We present YiSi, a unified automatic semantic machine translation quality evaluation and estimation metric for languages with different levels of available resources. Underneath the interface with different language resources settings, YiSi uses the same representation for the two sentences in assessment. Besides, we show significant improvement in the correlation of YiSi-1’s scores with human judgment is made by using contextual embeddings in multilingual BERT–Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers to evaluate lexical semantic similarity. YiSi is open source and publicly available.",
