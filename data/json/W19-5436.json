  "abstract": "The WMT19 Parallel Corpus Filtering For Low-Resource Conditions Task aims to test various methods of filtering a noisy parallel corpora, to make them useful for training machine translation systems. This year the noisy corpora are the relatively low-resource language pairs of Nepali-English and Sinhala-English. This papers describes the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) submissions, including preprocessing methods and scoring metrics. Numerical results indicate a benefit over baseline and the relative benefits of different options.",
