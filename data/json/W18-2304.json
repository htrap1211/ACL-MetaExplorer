  "abstract": "We propose keyphrases extraction technique to extract important terms from the healthcare user-generated contents. We employ deep learning architecture, i.e. Long Short-Term Memory, and leverage word embeddings, medical concepts from a knowledge base, and linguistic components as our features. The proposed model achieves 61.37% F-1 score. Experimental results indicate that our proposed approach outperforms the baseline methods, i.e. RAKE and CRF, on the task of extracting keyphrases from Indonesian health forum posts.",
