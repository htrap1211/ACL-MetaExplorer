  "abstract": "People are expressing their opinions online for a lot of years now. Although these opinions and comments provide people an opportunity of expressing their views, there is a lot of hate speech that can be found online. More specifically, sexist comments are very popular affecting and creating a negative impact on a lot of women and girls online. This paper describes the approaches of the SemEval-2023 Task 10 competition for Explainable Online Sexism Detection (EDOS). The task has been divided into 3 subtasks, introducing different classes of sexist comments. We have approached these tasks using the bert-cased and uncased models which are trained on the annotated dataset that has been provided in the competition. Task A provided the best F1 score of 80% on the test set, and tasks B and C provided 58% and 40% respectively.",
