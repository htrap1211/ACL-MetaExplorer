  "abstract": "In this work we use consumed text to infer Big-5 personality inventories using data we have collected from the social media platform Reddit. We test our model on two datasets, sampled from participants who consumed either fiction content (N = 913) or news content (N = 213). We show that state-of-the-art models from a similar task using authored text do not translate well to this task, with average correlations ofr=.06between the modelâ€™s predictions and ground-truth personality inventory dimensions. We propose an alternate method of generating average personality labels for each piece of text consumed, under which our model achieves correlations as high asr=.34when predicting personality from the text being read.",
