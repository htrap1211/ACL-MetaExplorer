  "abstract": "This paper proposes a new second language learning task of generating a response including specified grammatical items. We consider two approaches: 1) fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (DialoGPT) by reinforcement learning and 2) providing a few-shot prompt to a large language model (GPT-3). For reinforcement learning, we examine combinations of three reward functions that consider grammatical items, diversity, and fluency. Our experiments confirm that both approaches can generate responses including the specified grammatical items and that it is crucial to consider fluency rather than diversity as the reward function.",
