  "abstract": "This paper describes our submission to Task 10 at SemEval 2023-Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS), divided into three subtasks. The recent rise in social media platforms has seen an increase in disproportionate levels of sexism experienced by women on social media platforms. This has made detecting and explaining online sexist content more important than ever to make social media safer and more accessible for women. Our approach consists of experimenting and finetuning BERT-based models and using a Majority Voting ensemble model that outperforms individual baseline model scores. Our system achieves a macro F1 score of 0.8392 for Task A, 0.6092 for Task B, and 0.4319 for Task C.",
