  "abstract": "For the grammatical error correction (GEC) task, there usually exist multiple correction ways for an erroneous input sentence, leading to multiple references. Observing the high proportion of multi-reference instances in Chinese GEC training data, we target a systematic study on how to better utilize multi-reference training data. We propose two new approaches and a simple two-stage training strategy. We compare them against previously proposed approaches, on two Chinese training datasets, i.e., Lang-8 for second language learner texts and FCGEC-Train for native speaker texts, and three test datasets. The experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches and reveal interesting insights. Our code is available at https://github.com/ymliucs/MrGEC.",
