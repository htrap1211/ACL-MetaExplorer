  "abstract": "Clinical Natural Language Processing has been an increasingly popular research area in the NLP community. With the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their impressive abilities in NLP tasks, it is crucial to pay attention to their clinical applications. Sequence to sequence generative approaches with LLMs have been widely used in recent years. To be a part of the research in clinical NLP with recent advances in the field, we participated in task A of MEDIQA-Chat at ACL-ClinicalNLP Workshop 2023. In this paper, we explain our methods and findings as well as our comments on our results and limitations.",
