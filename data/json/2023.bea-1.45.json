  "abstract": "Online learning platforms offer a wealth of educational material, but as the amount of content on these platforms grows, students may struggle to determine the most efficient order in which to cover the material to achieve a particular learning objective. In this paper, we propose a feature-based method for identifying pre-requisite dependencies between academic videos. Our approach involves using a transcript engine with a language model to transcribe domain-specific terms and then extracting novel similarity-based features to determine pre-requisite dependencies between video transcripts. This approach succeeds due to the development of a novel corpus of K-12 academic text, which was created using a proposed feature-based document parser. We evaluate our method on hand-annotated datasets for transcript extraction, video pre-requisites determination, and textbook parsing, which we have released. Our method for pre-requisite edge determination shows significant improvement (+4.7%-10.24% F1-score) compared to existing methods.",
