  "abstract": "Moving beyond post-editing machine translation, a number of recent research efforts have advanced computer aided translation methods that allow for more interactivity, richer information such as confidence scores, and the completed feedback loop of instant adaptation of machine translation models to user translations.This tutorial will explain the main techniques for several aspects of computer aided translation: confidence measures;interactive machine translation (interactive translation prediction);bilingual concordancers;translation option display;paraphrasing (alternative translation suggestions);visualization of word alignment;online adaptation;automatic reviewing;integration of translation memory;eye tracking, logging, and cognitive user models;For each of these, the state of the art and open challenges are presented. The tutorial will also look under the hood of the open source CASMACAT toolkit that is based on MATECAT, and available as a \"Home Edition\" to be installed on a desktop machine. The target audience of this tutorials are researchers interested in computer aided machine translation and practitioners who want to use or deploy advanced CAT technology.",
