  "abstract": "The purpose of the research is to answer the question whether linguistic information is retained in vector representations of sentences. We introduce a method of analysing the content of sentence embeddings based on universal probing tasks, along with the classification datasets for two contrasting languages. We perform a series of probing and downstream experiments with different types of sentence embeddings, followed by a thorough analysis of the experimental results. Aside from dependency parser-based embeddings, linguistic information is retained best in the recently proposed LASER sentence embeddings.",
