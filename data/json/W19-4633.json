  "abstract": "This paper describes the approach adopted by the SMarT research group to build a dialect identification system in the framework of the Madar shared task on Arabic fine-grained dialect identification. We experimented several approaches, but we finally decided to use a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier based on word and character ngrams in addition to the language model probabilities. We achieved a score of 67.73% in terms of Macro accuracy and a macro-averaged F1-score of 67.31%",
