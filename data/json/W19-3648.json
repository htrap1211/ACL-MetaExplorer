  "abstract": "We describe work in progress for evaluating performance of sequence-to-sequence neural networks on the task of syntax-based reordering for rules applicable to simultaneous machine translation. We train models that attempt to rewrite English sentences using rules that are commonly used by human interpreters. We examine the performance of these models to determine which forms of rewriting are more difficult for them to learn and which architectures are the best at learning them.",
