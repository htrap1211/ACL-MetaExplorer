  "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) of drug and disorder/body function mentions in web text is challenging in the face of multilingualism, limited data, and poor data quality. Traditional small-scale models struggle to cope with the task. Large language models with conventional prompts also yield poor results. In this paper, we introduce our system, which employs a large language model (LLM) with a novel two-step prompting strategy. Instead of directly extracting the target medical entities, our system firstly extract all entities and then prompt the LLM to extract drug and disorder entities given the all-entity list and original input text as the context. The experimental and test results indicate that this strategy successfully enhanced our system performance, especially for German language.",
