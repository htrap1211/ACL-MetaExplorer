  "abstract": "This system description paper presents the details of our primary and contrastive approaches to translating Maltese into English for IWSLT 24. The Maltese language shares a large vocabulary with Arabic and Italian languages, thus making it an ideal candidate to test the cross-lingual capabilities of recent state-of-the-art models. We experiment with two end-to-end approaches for our submissions: the Whisper and wav2vec 2.0 models. Our primary system gets a BLEU score of 35.1 on the combined data, whereas our contrastive approach gets 18.5. We also provide a manual analysis of our contrastive approach to identify some pitfalls that may have caused this difference.",
