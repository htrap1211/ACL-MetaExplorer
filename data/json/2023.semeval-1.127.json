  "abstract": "This paper describes our participation as team FramingFreaks in the SemEval-2023 task 3 “Category and Framing Predictions in online news in a multi-lingual setup.” We participated in subtasks 1 and 2. Our approach was to classify texts by splitting them into subwords to reduce the feature set size and then using these tokens as input in Support Vector Machine (SVM) or logistic regression classifiers. Our results are similar to the baseline results.",
