  "abstract": "We present new results for the problem of sequence metaphor labeling, using the recently developed Visibility Embeddings. We show that concatenating such embeddings to the input of a BiLSTM obtains consistent and significant improvements at almost no cost, and we present further improved results when visibility embeddings are combined with BERT.",
