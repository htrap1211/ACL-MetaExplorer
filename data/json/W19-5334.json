  "abstract": "This paper describes the submissions of the eTranslation team to the WMT 2019 news translation shared task. The systems have been developed with the aim of identifying and following rather than establishing best practices, under the constraints imposed by a low resource training and decoding environment normally used for our production systems. Thus most of the findings and results are transferable to systems used in the eTranslation service. Evaluations suggest that this approach is able to produce decent models with good performance and speed without the overhead of using prohibitively deep and complex architectures.",
