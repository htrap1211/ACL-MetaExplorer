  "abstract": "This paper presents our work for the Task 5 of the Social Media Mining for Health Applications 2024 Shared Task - Binary classification of English tweets reporting childrenâ€™s medical disorders. In this paper, we present and compare multiple approaches for automatically classifying tweets from parents based on whether they mention having a child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), delayed speech, or asthma. We use ensemble of various BERT-based models trained on provided dataset that yields an F1 score of0.901on the test data.",
