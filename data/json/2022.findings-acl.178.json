  "abstract": "Many recent deep learning-based solutions have adopted the attention mechanism in various tasks in the field of NLP. However, the inherent characteristics of deep learning models and the flexibility of the attention mechanism increase the modelsâ€™ complexity, thus leading to challenges in model explainability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel practical framework by utilizing a two-tier attention architecture to decouple the complexity of explanation and the decision-making process. We apply it in the context of a news article classification task. The experiments on two large-scaled news corpora demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve competitive performance with many state-of-the-art alternatives and illustrate its appropriateness from an explainability perspective. We release the source code here.",
