  "abstract": "This paper describes the participation of the MLLP research group of the Universitat Politècnica de València in the WMT 2019 Similar Language Translation Shared Task. We have submitted systems for the Portuguese ↔ Spanish language pair, in both directions. We have submitted systems based on the Transformer architecture as well as an in development novel architecture which we have called 2D alternating RNN. We have carried out domain adaptation through fine-tuning.",
