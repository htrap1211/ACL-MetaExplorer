  "abstract": "“Leichte Sprache”, the German counterpart to Simple English, is a regulated language aiming to facilitate complex written language that would otherwise stay inaccessible to different groups of people. We present a new sentence-aligned monolingual corpus for Simple German – German. It contains multiple document-aligned sources which we have aligned using automatic sentence-alignment methods. We evaluate our alignments based on a manually labelled subset of aligned documents. The quality of our sentence alignments, as measured by the F1-score, surpasses previous work. We publish the dataset under CC BY-SA and the accompanying code under MIT license.",
