  "abstract": "This survey analyses how external knowledge can be integrated into language models in the context of retrieval-augmentation.The main goal of this work is to give an overview of: (1) Which external knowledge can be augmented? (2) Given a knowledge source, how to retrieve from it and then integrate the retrieved knowledge? To achieve this, we define and give a mathematical formulation of retrieval-augmented knowledge integration (RAKI). We discuss retrieval and integration techniques separately in detail, for each of the following knowledge formats: knowledge graph, tabular and natural language.",
