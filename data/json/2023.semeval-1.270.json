  "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce our submission in the task of visual word sense disambiguation (vWSD). Our proposed solution operates by deriving quasi-symbolic semantic categories from the hidden representations of multi-modal text-image encoders. Our results are mixed, as we manage to achieve a substantial boost in performance when evaluating on a validation set, however, we experienced detrimental effects during evaluation on the actual test set. Our positive results on the validation set confirms the validity of the quasi-symbolic features, whereas our results on the test set revealed that the proposed technique was not able to cope with the sufficiently different distribution of the test data.",
