  "abstract": "This paper describes the participation of the UMUTeam in the Learning With Disagreements (Le-Wi-Di) shared task proposed at SemEval 2023, which objective is the development of supervised automatic classifiers that consider, during training, the agreements and disagreements among the annotators of the datasets. Specifically, this edition includes a multilingual dataset. Our proposal is grounded on the development of ensemble learning classifiers that combine the outputs of several Large Language Models. Our proposal ranked position 18 of a total of 30 participants. However, our proposal did not incorporate the information about the disagreements. In contrast, we compare the performance of building several classifiers for each dataset separately with a merged dataset.",
