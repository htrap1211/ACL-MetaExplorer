  "abstract": "Discriminating antonyms and synonyms is an important NLP task that has the difficulty that both, antonyms and synonyms, contains similar distributional information. Consequently, pairs of antonyms and synonyms may have similar word vectors. We present an approach to unravel antonymy and synonymy from word vectors based on a siamese network inspired approach. The model consists of a two-phase training of the same base network: a pre-training phase according to a siamese model supervised by synonyms and a training phase on antonyms through a siamese-like model that supports the antitransitivity present in antonymy. The approach makes use of the claim that the antonyms in common of a word tend to be synonyms. We show that our approach outperforms distributional and pattern-based approaches, relaying on a simple feed forward network as base network of the training phases.",
