  "abstract": "We introduce the Korean-Learner-Morpheme (KLM) corpus, a manually annotated dataset consisting of 129,784 morphemes from second language (L2) learners of Korean, featuring morpheme tokenization and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. We evaluate the performance of four Korean morphological analyzers in tokenization and POS tagging on the L2- Korean corpus. Results highlight the analyzersâ€™ reduced performance on L2 data, indicating the limitation of advanced deep-learning models when dealing with L2-Korean corpora. We further show that fine-tuning one of the models with the KLM corpus improves its accuracy of tokenization and POS tagging on L2-Korean dataset.",
