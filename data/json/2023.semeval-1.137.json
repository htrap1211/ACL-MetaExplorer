  "abstract": "The goal of the NLI4CT task is to build a Natural Language Inference system for Clinical Trial Reports that will be used for evidence interpretation and retrieval. Large Language models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various natural language processing tasks across multiple domains. We suggest using an instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to take on this particular task in light of these developments. We have evaluated the publicly available LLMs under zeroshot setting, and finetuned the best performing Flan-T5 model for this task. On the leaderboard, our system ranked second, with an F1 Score of 0.834 on the official test set.",
