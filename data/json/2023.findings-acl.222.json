  "abstract": "Well pre-trained contextualized representations from pre-trained language model (PLM) have been shown helpful for enhancing various natural language processing tasks, surely including neural machine translation (NMT). However, existing methods either consider encoder-only enhancement or rely on specific multilingual PLMs, which leads to a much larger model or give up potentially helpful knowledge from target PLMs. In this paper, we propose a new monolingual PLM-sponsored NMT model to let both encoder and decoder enjoy PLM enhancement to alleviate such obvious inconvenience. Especially, incorporating a newly proposed frequency-weighted embedding transformation algorithm, PLM embeddings can be effectively exploited in terms of the representations of the NMT decoder. We evaluate our model on IWSLT14 En-De, De-En, WMT14 En-De, and En-Fr tasks, and the results show that our proposed PLM enhancement gives significant improvement and even helps achieve new state-of-the-art.",
