  "abstract": "This study introduces the system submitted to the SemEval 2022 Task 2: MultiCoNER II (Multilingual Complex Named Entity Recognition) by the LSJSP team. We propose FTBC, a FastText-based framework with pre-trained Bert for NER tasks with complex entities and over a noisy dataset. Our system achieves an average of 58.27% F1 score (fine-grained) and 75.79% F1 score (coarse-grained) across all languages. FTBC outperforms the baseline BERT-CRF model on all 12 monolingual tracks.",
