  "abstract": "Communicating scientific research to the general public is an essential yet challenging task. Lay summaries, which provide a simplified version of research findings, can bridge the gapbetween scientific knowledge and public understanding. The BioLaySumm task (Goldsack et al., 2023) is a shared task that seeks to automate this process by generating lay summaries from biomedical articles. Two different datasets that have been created from curating two biomedical journals (PLOS and eLife) are provided by the task organizers. As a participant in this shared task, we developed a system to generate a lay summary from an articleâ€™s abstract and main text.",
