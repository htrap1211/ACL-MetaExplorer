  "abstract": "This paper summarizes our participation in the Shared Task 4 of #SMM4H 2024. Task 4 was a named entity recognition (NER) task identifying clinical and social impacts of non-medical substance use in English Reddit posts. We employed the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to complete this task. Our team achieved an F1-score of 0.892 on a validation set and a relaxed F1-score of 0.191 on the test set.",
