  "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on extracting entities such as names of people, organizations, locations, and dates from text. Despite significant advancements due to deep learning and transformer architectures like BERT, NER still faces challenges, particularly in low-resource languages like Arabic. This paper presents a BERT-based NER system that utilizes a two-channel parallel hybrid neural network with an attention mechanism specifically designed for the NER Shared Task 2024. In the competition, our approach ranked second by scoring 90.13% in micro-F1 on the test set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining advanced neural network architectures with contextualized word embeddings in improving NER performance for Arabic.",
