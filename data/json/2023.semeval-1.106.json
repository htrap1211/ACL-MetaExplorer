  "abstract": "This paper describes our system used in the SemEval-2023 Task 9 Multilingual Tweet Intimacy Analysis. There are two key challenges in this task: the complexity of multilingual and zero-shot cross-lingual learning, and the difficulty of semantic mining of tweet intimacy. To solve the above problems, our system extracts contextual representations from the pretrained language models, XLM-T, and employs various optimization methods, including adversarial training, data augmentation, ordinal regression loss and special training strategy. Our system ranked 14th out of 54 participating teams on the leaderboard and ranked 10th on predicting languages not in the training data. Our code is available on Github.",
