  "abstract": "Navigating the intricacies of machine translation (MT) involves tackling the nuanced disparities between Arabic dialects and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), presenting a formidable obstacle. In this study, we delve into Subtask 3 of the NADI shared task (CITATION), focusing on the translation of sentences from four distinct Arabic dialects into MSA. Our investigation explores the efficacy of various models, including Jais, NLLB, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, in this dialect-to-MSA translation endeavor. Our findings reveal that Jais surpasses all other models, boasting an average BLEU score of 19.48 in the combination of zero- and few-shot setting, whereas NLLB exhibits the least favorable performance, garnering a BLEU score of 8.77.",
