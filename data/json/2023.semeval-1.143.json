  "abstract": "In this paper we present and discuss the results achieved by the “Augustine of Hippo” team at SemEval-2023 Task 4 about human value detection. In particular, we provide a quantitative and qualitative reviews of the results obtained by SuperASKE, discussing respectively performance metrics and classification errors. Finally, we present our main contribution: an explainable and unsupervised approach mapping arguments to concepts, followed by a supervised classification model mapping concepts to human values.",
