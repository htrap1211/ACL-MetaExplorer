  "abstract": "We present that, the rank-frequency relation in textual data followsf ∝ r-𝛼(r+𝛾)-𝛽, wherefis the token frequency andris the rank by frequency, with (𝛼,𝛽,𝛾) as parameters. The formulation is derived based on the empirical observation thatd2(x+y)/dx2is a typical impulse function, where(x,y)=(logr,logf). The formulation is the power law when𝛽=0and the Zipf–Mandelbrot law when𝛼=0. We illustrate that𝛼is related to the analytic features of syntax and𝛽+𝛾to those of morphology in natural languages from an investigation of multilingual corpora.",
