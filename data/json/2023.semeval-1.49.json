  "abstract": "In this paper, we describe our submissions to the SemEval-2023 contest. We tackled subtask 12 - “AfriSenti-SemEval: Sentiment Analysis for Low-resource African Languages using Twitter Dataset”. We developed different models for 12 African languages and a 13th model for a multilingual dataset built from these 12 languages. We applied a wide variety of word and char n-grams based on their tf-idf values, 4 classical machine learning methods, 2 deep learning methods, and 3 oversampling methods. We used 12 sentiment lexicons and applied extensive hyperparameter tuning.",
