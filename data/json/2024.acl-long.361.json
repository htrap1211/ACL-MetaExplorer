  "abstract": "Automated Fact-Checking (AFC) is the automated verification of claim accuracy. AFC is crucial in discerning truth from misinformation, especially given the huge amounts of content are generated online daily. Current research focuses on predicting claim veracity through metadata analysis and language scrutiny, with an emphasis on justifying verdicts. This paper surveys recent methodologies, proposinga comprehensive taxonomy and presenting the evolution of research in that landscape. A comparative analysis of methodologies and futuredirections for improving fact-checking explainability are also discussed.",
