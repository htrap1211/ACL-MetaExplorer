  "abstract": "This paper introduces our system for the SemEval 2023 Task 2: Multilingual Complex Named Entity Recognition (MultiCoNER II) competition. Our team focused on the sub-task of Named Entity Recognition (NER) for the language of English in the challenge and reported our results. To achieve our goal, we utilized transfer learning by fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on the competition dataset. Our approach involved combining a BERT-based PLM with external knowledge to provide additional context to the model. In this report, we present our findings and results.",
