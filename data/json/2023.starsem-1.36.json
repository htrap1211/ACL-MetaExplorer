  "abstract": "In this study, we propose using the GPT-3 as a query generator for the backend of CLIP as an implicit word sense disambiguation (WSD) component for the SemEval 2023 shared task Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD). We confirmed previous findings â€” human-like prompts adapted for WSD with quotes benefit both CLIP and GPT-3, whereas plain phrases or poorly templated prompts give the worst results.",
