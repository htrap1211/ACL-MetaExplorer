  "abstract": "The task shared by sponsor about Hope Speech Detection for Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion at LT-EDI-ACL-2022.The goal of this task is to identify whether a given comment contains hope speech or not,and hope is considered significant for the well-being, recuperation and restoration of human life. Our work aims to change the prevalent way of thinking by moving away from a preoccupation with discrimination, loneliness or the worst things in life to building the confidence, support and good qualities based on comments by individuals. In response to the need to detect equality, diversity and inclusion of hope speech in a multilingual environment, we built an integration model and achieved well performance on multiple datasets presented by the sponsor and the specific results can be referred to the experimental results section.",
