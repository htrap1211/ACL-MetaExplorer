  "abstract": "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is an important subtask in Natural Language Processing (NLP). More recent research within ABSA have consistently focused on conducting more precise sentiment analysis on aspects, i.e., dimensional Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (dimABSA). However, previous approaches have not systematically explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dimABSA. To fill the gap, we propose a novel In-Context Learning (ICL) structure with a novel aspect-aware ICL example selection method, to enhance the performance of LLMs in dimABSA. Experiments show that our proposed ICL structure significantly improves the fine-grained sentiment analysis abilities of LLMs.",
