  "abstract": "This paper explores the possibility to exploit different Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) to assist in a manual annotation task consisting in assigning the appropriate sense to verbal predicates in a Latin text. Indeed, this represents a crucial step when annotating data according to the Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR) framework, designed to annotate the semantic content of a text in a cross-linguistic perspective. We approach the study as a Word Sense Disambiguation task, with the primary goal of assessing the feasibility of leveraging available resources for Latin to streamline the labor-intensive annotation process. Our methodology revolves around the exploitation of contextual embeddings to compute token similarity, under the assumption that predicates sharing a similar sense would also share their context of occurrence. We discuss our findings, emphasizing applicability and limitations of this approach in the context of Latin, for which the limited amount of available resources poses additional challenges.",
