  "abstract": "Automatic monitoring systems for inappropriate user-generated messages have been found to be effective in reducing human operation costs in Consumer to Consumer (C2C) marketplace services, in which customers send messages directly to other customers. We propose a lightweight neural network that takes a conversation as input, which we deployed to a production service. Our results show that the system reduced the human operation costs to less than one-sixth compared to the conventional rule-based monitoring at Mercari.",
