This paper describes our system that we used to participate in this shared task. Our model is an ensemble of different variants of fine tuned DeBERTa models that employs a k-fold cross-validation. We have participated in the three tasks A, B and C. Our model ranked 2 nd position in tasks A, 7 th in task B and 4 th in task C.",
