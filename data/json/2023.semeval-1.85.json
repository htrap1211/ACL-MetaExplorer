  "abstract": "In this manuscript, we describe the participation of the UMUTeam in SemEval-2023 Task 5, namely, Clickbait Spoiling, a shared task on identifying spoiler type (i.e., a phrase or a passage) and generating short texts that satisfy curiosity induced by a clickbait post, i.e. generating spoilers for the clickbait post. Our participation in Task 1 is based on fine-tuning pre-trained models, which consists in taking a pre-trained model and tuning it to fit the spoiler classification task. Our system has obtained excellent results in Task 1: we outperformed all proposed baselines, being within the Top 10 for most measures. Foremost, we reached Top 3 in F1 score in the passage spoiler ranking.",
