  "abstract": "We present the LCT-EHU submission to the AmericasNLP 2023 low-resource machine translation shared task. We focus on the Spanish-Quechua language pair and explore the usage of different approaches: (1) Obtain new parallel corpora from the literature and legal domains, (2) Compare a high-resource Spanish-English pre-trained MT model with a Spanish-Finnish pre-trained model (with Finnish being chosen as a target language due to its morphological similarity to Quechua), and (3) Explore additional techniques such as copied corpus and back-translation. Overall, we show that the Spanish-Finnish pre-trained model outperforms other setups, while low-quality synthetic data reduces the performance.",
