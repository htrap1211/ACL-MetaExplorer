  "abstract": "With the development of robotics, the use of robots in daily life is increasing, which has led to the need for anyone to easily train robots to improve robot use. Interactive reinforcement learning(IARL) is a method for robot training based on humanâ€“robot interaction; prior studies on IARL provide only limited types of feedback or require appropriately designed shaping rewards, which is known to be difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, in this study, we propose interactive deep reinforcement learning models based on voice feedback. In the proposed system, a robot learns the task of cooperative table balancing through deep Q-network using voice feedback provided by humans in real-time, with automatic speech recognition(ASR) and sentiment analysis to understand human voice feedback. As a result, an optimal policy convergence rate of up to 96% was realized, and performance was improved in all voice feedback-based models",
