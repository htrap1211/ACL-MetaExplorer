  "abstract": "In this work, we present a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system that was trained using a Frustratingly Easy Domain Adaptation (FEDA) over multiple legal corpora. The goal was to create a NER capable of detecting 14 types of legal named entities in Indian judgments. Besides the FEDA architecture, we explored a method based on overlapping context and averaging tensors to process long input texts, which can be beneficial when processing legal documents. The proposed NER reached an F1-score of 0.9007 in the sub-task B of Semeval-2023 Task 6, Understanding Legal Texts.",
