  "abstract": "The BioLaySumm 2024 shared task at the ACL 2024 BioNLP workshop aims to transform biomedical research articles into lay summaries suitable for a broad audience, including children. We utilize the BioBART model, designed for the biomedical sector, to convert complex scientific data into clear, concise summaries. Our dataset, which includes a range of scientific abstracts, enables us to address the diverse information needs of our audience. This focus ensures that our summaries are accessible to both general and younger lay audience. Additionally, we employ specialized tokens and augmentation techniques to optimize the modelâ€™s performance. Our methodology proved effective, earning us the 7th rank on the final leaderboard out of 57 participants.",
