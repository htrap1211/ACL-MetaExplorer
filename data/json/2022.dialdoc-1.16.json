  "abstract": "Information-seeking dialogue systems, including knowledge identification and response generation, aim to respond to users with fluent, coherent, and informative answers based on usersâ€™ needs. This paper discusses our proposed approach,Docalog, for the DialDoc-22 (MultiDoc2Dial) shared task.Docalogidentifies the most relevant knowledge in the associated document, in a multi-document setting.Docalog, is a three-stage pipeline consisting of(1) a document retriever model (DR. TEIT),(2) an answer span prediction model, and(3) an ultimate span pickerdeciding on the most likely answer span, out of all predicted spans. In the test phase of MultiDoc2Dial 2022,Docalogachieved f1-scores of 36.07% and 28.44% and SacreBLEU scores of 23.70% and 20.52%, respectively on theMDD-SEENandMDD-UNSEENfolds.",
