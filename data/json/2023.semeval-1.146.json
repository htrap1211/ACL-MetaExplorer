  "abstract": "The Clickbait Spoiling shared task aims at tackling two aspects of spoiling: classifying the spoiler type based on its length and generating the spoiler. This paper focuses on the task of classifying the spoiler type. Better classification of the spoiler type would eventually help in generating a better spoiler for the post. We use BERT-base (cased) to classify the clickbait posts. The model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.63 as we give only the post content as the input to our model instead of the concatenation of the post title and post content to find out the differences that the post title might be bringing in.",
