  "abstract": "In SemEval-2023 Task 1, a task of applying Word Sense Disambiguation in an image retrieval system was introduced. To resolve this task, this work proposes three approaches: (1) an unsupervised approach considering similarities between word senses and image captions, (2) a supervised approach using a Siamese neural network, and (3) a self-supervised approach using a Bayesian personalized ranking framework. According to the results, both supervised and self-supervised approaches outperformed the unsupervised approach. They can effectively identify correct images of ambiguous words in the dataset provided in this task.",
