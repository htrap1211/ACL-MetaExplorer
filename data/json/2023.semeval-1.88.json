  "abstract": "This paper introduces our participating system to the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS) SemEval-2023 - Task 10: Explainable Detection of Online Sexism. The EDOS shared task covers three hierarchical sub-tasks for sexism detection, coarse-grained and fine-grained categorization. We have investigated both single-task and multi-task learning based on RoBERTa transformer-based language models. For improving the results, we have performed further pre-training of RoBERTa on the provided unlabeled data. Besides, we have employed a small sample of the unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning using the minimum class-confusion loss. Our system has achieved macro F1 scores of 82.25\\%, 67.35\\%, and 49.8\\% on Tasks A, B, and C, respectively.",
