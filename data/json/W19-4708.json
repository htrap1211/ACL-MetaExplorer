  "abstract": "The concept of ‘markedness’ has been influential in phonology for almost a century. Theoretical phonology has found it useful to describe some segments as more ‘marked’ than others, referring to a cluster of language-internal and -external properties (Jakobson 1968, Haspelmath 2006). We argue, using a simple mathematical model based on Evolutionary Phonology (Blevins 2004), that markedness is an epiphenomenon of phonetically grounded sound change.",
