  "abstract": "In news articles the lead bias is a common phenomenon that usually dominates the learning signals for neural extractive summarizers, severely limiting their performance on data with different or even no bias. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique to demote lead bias and make the summarizer focus more on the content semantics. Experiments on two news corpora with different degrees of lead bias show that our method can effectively demote the modelâ€™s learned lead bias and improve its generality on out-of-distribution data, with little to no performance loss on in-distribution data.",
