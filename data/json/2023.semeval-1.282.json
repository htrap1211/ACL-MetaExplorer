  "abstract": "This paper describes our system (iREL) for Tweet intimacy analysis sharedtask of the SemEval 2023 workshop at ACL 2023. Oursystem achieved an overall Pearson’s r score of 0.5924 and ranked 10th on the overall leaderboard. For the unseen languages, we ranked third on the leaderboard and achieved a Pearson’s r score of 0.485. We used a single multilingual model for all languages, as discussed in this paper. We provide a detailed description of our pipeline along with multiple ablation experiments to further analyse each component of the pipeline. We demonstrate how translation-based augmentation, domain-specific features, and domain-adapted pre-trained models improve the understanding of intimacy in tweets.
