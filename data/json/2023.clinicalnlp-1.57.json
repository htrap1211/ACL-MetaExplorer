  "abstract": "This paper presents the results of the Data Science for Digital Health (DS4DH) group in the MEDIQA-Chat Tasks at ACL-ClinicalNLP 2023. Our study combines the power of a classical machine learning method, Support Vector Machine, for classifying medical dialogues, along with the implementation of one-shot prompts using GPT-3.5. We employ dialogues and summaries from the same category as prompts to generate summaries for novel dialogues. Our findings exceed the average benchmark score, offering a robust reference for assessing performance in this field.",
