  "abstract": "The Human Value Detection shared task\\cite{kiesel:2023} aims to classify whether or not the argument draws on a set of 20 value categories, given a textual argument. This is a difficult task as the discrimination of human values behind arguments is often implicit. Moreover, the number of label categories can be up to 20 and the distribution of data is highly imbalanced. To address these issues, we employ a multi-label classification model and utilize a class-balanced loss function. Our system wins 5 first places, 2 second places, and 6 third places out of 20 categories of the Human Value Detection shared task, and our overall average score of 0.54 also places third. The code is publicly available at \\url{https://www.github.com/diqiuzhuanzhuan/semeval2023}.",
