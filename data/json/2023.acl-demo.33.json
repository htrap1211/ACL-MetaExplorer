  "abstract": "This paper introduces the Unified Interactive Natural Understanding of the Italian Language (UINAUIL), a benchmark of six tasks for Italian Natural Language Understanding. We present a description of the tasks and software library that collects the data from the European Language Grid, harmonizes the data format, and exposes functionalities to facilitates data manipulation and the evaluation of custom models. We also present the results of tests conducted with available Italian and multilingual language models on UINAUIL, providing an updated picture of the current state of the art in Italian NLU.",
