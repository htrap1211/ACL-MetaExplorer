  "abstract": "DepSign-LT-EDI@ACL-2022 aims to ascer-tain the signs of depression of a person fromtheir messages and posts on social mediawherein people share their feelings and emo-tions. Given social media postings in English,the system should classify the signs of depres-sion into three labels namely “not depressed”,“moderately depressed”, and “severely de-pressed”. To achieve this objective, we haveadopted a fine-tuned BERT model. This solu-tion from team SSN_MLRG1 achieves 58.5%accuracy on the DepSign-LT-EDI@ACL-2022test set.",
