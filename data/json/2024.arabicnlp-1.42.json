  "abstract": "In this paper, a description of the system submitted by BFCAI team to the AraFinNLP2024 shared task has been introduced. Our team participated in the first subtask, which aims at detecting the customer intents of cross-dialectal Arabic queries in the banking domain. Our system follows the common pipeline of text classification models using primary classification algorithms integrated with basic vectorization approach for feature extraction. Multi-layer Perceptron, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Support Vector Machines algorithms have been implemented and support vector machines outperformed all other algorithms with an f-score of 49%. Our submission’s result is appropriate compared to the simplicity of the proposed model’s structure.",
