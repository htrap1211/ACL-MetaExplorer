  "abstract": "As AI-generated text increasingly resembles human-written content, the ability to detect machine-generated text becomes crucial in both the computational linguistics and machine learning communities. In this tutorial, we aim to provide an in-depth exploration of text watermarking, a subfield of linguistic steganography with the goal of embedding a hidden message (the watermark) within a text passage. We will introduce the fundamentals of text watermarking, discuss the main challenges in identifying AI-generated text, and delve into the current watermarking methods, assessing their strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, we will explore other possible applications of text watermarking and discuss future directions for this field. Each section will be supplemented with examples and key takeaways.",
