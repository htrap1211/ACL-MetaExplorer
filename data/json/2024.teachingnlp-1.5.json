  "abstract": "Traditional lectures have poorer outcomes compared to active learning methodologies, yet many natural language processing classes in higher education still follow this outdated methodology. In this paper, we present, co-creational teaching, a methodology that encourages partnership between staff and lecturers and show how this can be applied to teach natural language processing. As a fast-moving and dynamic area of study with high interest from students, natural language processing is an ideal subject for innovative teaching methodologies to improve student outcomes. We detail our experience with teaching natural language processing through partnership with students and provide detailed descriptions of methodologies that can be used by others in their teaching, including considerations of diverse student populations.",
