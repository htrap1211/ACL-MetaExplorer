  "abstract": "Understanding temporal relationships in text from electronic health records can be valuable for many important downstream clinical applications. Since Clinical TempEval 2017, there has been little work on end-to-end systems for temporal relation extraction, with most work focused on the setting where gold standard events and time expressions are given. In this work, we make use of a novel multi-headed attention mechanism on top of a pre-trained transformer encoder to allow the learning process to attend to multiple aspects of the contextualized embeddings. Our system achieves state of the art results on the THYME corpus by a wide margin, in both the in-domain and cross-domain settings.",
