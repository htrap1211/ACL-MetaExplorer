  "abstract": "This paper presents D2KLab’s system used for the shared task of “Multilingual Complex Named Entity Recognition (MultiCoNER II)”, as part of SemEval 2023 Task 2. The system relies on a fine-tuned transformer based language model for extracting named entities. In addition to the architecture of the system, we discuss our results and observations.",
