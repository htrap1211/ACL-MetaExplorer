  "abstract": "Generalized intent discovery aims to extend a closed-set in-domain intent classifier to an open-world intent set including in-domain and out-of-domain intents. The key challenges lie in pseudo label disambiguation and representation learning. Previous methods suffer from a coupling of pseudo label disambiguation and representation learning, that is, the reliability of pseudo labels relies on representation learning, and representation learning is restricted by pseudo labels in turn. In this paper, we propose a decoupled prototype learning framework (DPL) to decouple pseudo label disambiguation and representation learning. Specifically, we firstly introduce prototypical contrastive representation learning (PCL) to get discriminative representations. And then we adopt a prototype-based label disambiguation method (PLD) to obtain pseudo labels. We theoretically prove that PCL and PLD work in a collaborative fashion and facilitate pseudo label disambiguation. Experiments and analysis on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our method.",
