  "abstract": "In this paper, we give a brief survey of the difficulties in handling the syntax of mathematical expressions in Universal Dependencies, focusing on examples from English language corpora. We first examine the prevalence and current handling of mathematical expressions in UD corpora. We then examine several strategies for how to approach the handling of syntactic dependencies for such expressions: as multi-word expressions, as a domain appropriate for code-switching, or as approximate to other types of natural language. Ultimately, we argue that mathematical expressions should primarily be analyzed as natural language, and we offer recommendations for the treatment of basic mathematical expressions as analogous to English natural language.",
