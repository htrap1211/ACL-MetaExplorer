  "abstract": "Recent multilingual models benefit from strong unified semantic representation models. However, due to conflict linguistic regularities, ignoring language-specific features during multilingual learning may suffer from negative transfer. In this work, we analyze the relationbetween a languageâ€™s position space and its typological characterization, and suggest deploying different position spaces for different languages. We develop a position generation network which combines prior knowledge from typology features and existing position vectors. Experiments on the multilingual dependency parsing task show that the learned position vectors exhibit meaningful hidden structures, and they can help achieving the best multilingual parsing results.",
