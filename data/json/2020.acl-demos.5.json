  "abstract": "We introduce Talk to Papers, which exploits the recent open-domain question answering (QA) techniques to improve the current experience of academic search. Itâ€™s designed to enable researchers to use natural language queries to find precise answers and extract insights from a massive amount of academic papers. We present a large improvement over classic search engine baseline on several standard QA datasets and provide the community a collaborative data collection tool to curate the first natural language processing research QA dataset via a community effort.",
