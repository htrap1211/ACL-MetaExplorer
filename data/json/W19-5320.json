  "abstract": "This paper describes the participation of the MLLP research group of the Universitat Politècnica de València in the WMT 2019 News Translation Shared Task. In this edition, we have submitted systems for the German ↔ English and German ↔ French language pairs, participating in both directions of each pair. Our submitted systems, based on the Transformer architecture, make ample use of data filtering, synthetic data and domain adaptation through fine-tuning.",
