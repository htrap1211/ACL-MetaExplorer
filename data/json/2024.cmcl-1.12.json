  "abstract": "Babies’ daily auditory environment plays a crucial role in language development. Most previous research estimating the quantitative and qualitative aspects of early speech inputs has predominantly focused on English- and Spanish-speaking families. In addition, validation studies for daylong recordings’ analysis tools are scarce on French data sets.In this paper, we present a French corpus of daylong audio recordings longitudinally collected with the LENA (Language ENvironment Analysis) system from infants aged 3 to 24 months. We conduct a thorough exploration of this data set, which serves as a quality check for both the data and the analysis tools.We evaluate the reliability of LENA metrics by systematically comparing them with those obtained from the ChildProject set of tools and by checking the known dynamics of the metrics with age. These metrics are also used to replicate, on our data set, findings from (Warlaumont et al, 2014) about the increase of infants’ speech vocalizations and temporal contingencies between infants and caregivers with age.",
