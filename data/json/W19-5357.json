  "abstract": "This paper describes Meteor++ 2.0, our submission to the WMT19 Metric Shared Task. The well known Meteor metric improves machine translation evaluation by introducing paraphrase knowledge. However, it only focuses on the lexical level and utilizes consecutive n-grams paraphrases. In this work, we take into consideration syntactic level paraphrase knowledge, which sometimes may be skip-grams. We describe how such knowledge can be extracted from Paraphrase Database (PPDB) and integrated into Meteor-based metrics. Experiments on WMT15 and WMT17 evaluation datasets show that the newly proposed metric outperforms all previous versions of Meteor.",
