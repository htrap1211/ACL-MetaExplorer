  "abstract": "Ambiguity is a major obstacle to providing services based on sentence classification. However, because of the structural limitations of the service, there may not be sufficient contextual information to resolve the ambiguity. In this situation, we focus on ambiguity detection so that service design considering ambiguity is possible. We utilize similarity in a semantic space to detect ambiguity in service scenarios and training data. In addition, we apply task-specific embedding to improve performance. Our results demonstrate that ambiguities and resulting labeling errors in training data or scenarios can be detected. Additionally, we confirm that it can be used to debug services",
