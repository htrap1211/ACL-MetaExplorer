  "abstract": "Following the idea of “one translation per discourse”, in this paper we aim to improve translation consistency via document-level translation repair (DocRepair), i.e., automatic post-editing on translations of documents. To this end, we propose a lexical translation inconsistency-aware DocRepair to explicitly model translation inconsistency. First we locate the inconsistency in automatic translation. Then we provide translation candidates for those inconsistency. Finally, we propose lattice-like input to properly model inconsistent tokens and phrases and their candidates. Experimental results on three document-level translation datasets show that based on G-Transformer, a state-of-the-art document-to-document (Doc2Doc) translation model, our Doc2Doc DocRepair achieves significant improvement on translation quality in BLEU scores, but also greatly improves lexical translation consistency.",
