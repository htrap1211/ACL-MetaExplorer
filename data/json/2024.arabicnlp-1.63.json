  "abstract": "In this paper, we present our approach for FIGNEWS Subtask 1, which focuses on detecting bias in news media narratives about the Israel war on Gaza. We used a Large Language Model (LLM) and prompt engineering, using GPT-3.5 Turbo API, to create a model that automatically flags biased news media content with 99% accuracy. This approach provides Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers with a robust and effective solution for automating bias detection in news media narratives using supervised learning algorithms. Additionally, this paper provides a detailed analysis of the labeled content, offering valuable insights into media bias in conflict reporting. Our work advances automated content analysis and enhances understanding of media bias.",
