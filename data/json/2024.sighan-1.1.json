  "abstract": "Quote attribution in fiction refers to the extraction of dialogues and speaker identification of dialogues, which can be divided into 2 steps: quotation annotation and speaker annotation. We use a pipeline for quote attribution, which involves classification, extractive QA, multi-choice QA, and coreference resolution. We also had an evaluation of our model performance by predicting explicit and implicit speakers using a combination of different models.",
