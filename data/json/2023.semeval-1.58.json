The title is:Mao-Zedong At SemEval-2023 Task 4: Label Represention Multi-Head Attention Model With Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Nearest Neighbor Mechanism For Multi-Label Text Classification,and the author is Che Zhang and Pingan Liu and ZhenyangXiao and HaojunFei. In this paper, we propose a model that combinesthe label-specific attention network with the contrastive learning-enhanced nearest neighbor mechanism.",
