  "abstract": "This paper describes the submission of the TALP-UPC team to the Problem List Summarization task from the BioNLP 2023 workshop. This task consists of automatically extracting a list of health issues from the e-health medical record of a given patient. Our submission combines additional steps of data annotationwith finetuning of BERT pre-trained language models. Our experiments focus on the impact of finetuning on different datasets as well as the addition of data augmentation techniques to delay overfitting.",
