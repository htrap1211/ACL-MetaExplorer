  "abstract": "The BioNLP Workshop 2023 initiated the launch of a shared task on Problem List Summarization (ProbSum) in January 2023. The aim of this shared task is to attract future research efforts in building NLP models for real-world diagnostic decision support applications, where a system generating relevant and accurate diagnoses will augment the healthcare providersâ€™ decision-making process and improve the quality of care for patients. The goal for participants is to develop models that generated a list of diagnoses and problems using input from the daily care notes collected from the hospitalization of critically ill patients. Eight teams submitted their final systems to the shared task leaderboard. In this paper, we describe the tasks, datasets, evaluation metrics, and baseline systems. Additionally, the techniques and results of the evaluation of the different approaches tried by the participating teams are summarized.",
