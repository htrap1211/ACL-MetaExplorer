  "abstract": "This paper presents HW-TSC’s submissions to the IWSLT 2023 Offline Speech Translation task, including speech translation of talks from English to German, Chinese, and Japanese, respectively. We participate in all three conditions (constrained training, constrained with large language models training, and unconstrained training) with models of cascaded architectures. We use data enhancement, pre-training models and other means to improve the ASR quality, and R-Drop, deep model, domain data selection, etc. to improve the translation quality. Compared with last year’s best results, we achieve 2.1 BLEU improvement on the MuST-C English-German test set.",
