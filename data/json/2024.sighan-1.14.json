  "abstract": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis(ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task, which aims to extract multiple specific sentiment elements from text. The current aspect-based sentiment analysis task mainly involves four basic elements: aspect term, aspect category, opinion term, and sentiment polarity. With the development of ABSA, methods for predicting the four sentiment elements are gradually increasing. However, traditional ABSA usually only distinguishes between “positive”, “negative”, or “neutral”attitudes when judging sentiment polarity, and this simplified classification method makes it difficult to highlight the sentimentintensity of different reviews. SIGHAN 2024 provides a more challenging evaluation task, the Chinese dimensional ABSA shared task (dimABSA), which replaces the traditional sentiment polarity judgment task with a dataset in a multidimensional space with continuous sentiment intensity scores, including valence and arousal. Continuous sentiment intensity scores can obtain more detailed emotional information. In this task, we propose a new paraphrase generation paradigm that uses generative questioning in an end-to-end manner to predict sentiment intensity quadruples, which can fully utilize semantic information and reduce propagation errors in the pipeline approach.",
