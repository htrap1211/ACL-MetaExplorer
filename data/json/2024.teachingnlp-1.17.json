  "abstract": "We present a novel tool designed for teaching and interfacing the information-theoretic modeling abilities of large language models. The Surprisal Toolkit allows students from diverse linguistic and programming backgrounds to learn about measures of information theory and natural language processing (NLP) through an online interactive tool. In addition, the interface provides a valuable research mechanism for obtaining measures of surprisal. We implement the toolkit as part of a classroom tutorial in three different learning scenarios and discuss the overall receptive student feedback. We suggest this toolkit and similar applications as resourceful supplements to instruction in NLP topics, especially for the purpose of balancing conceptual understanding with technical instruction, grounding abstract topics, and engaging students with varying coding abilities.",
