  "abstract": "Extrapolation reasoning on temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) aims to forecast future facts based on past counterparts. There are two main challenges: (1) incorporating the complex information, including structural dependencies, temporal dynamics, and hidden logical rules; (2) implementing differentiable logical rule learning and reasoning for explainability. To this end, we propose an explainable extrapolation reasoning framework TEemporal logiCal grapH networkS (TECHS), which mainly contains a temporal graph encoder and a logical decoder. The former employs a graph convolutional network with temporal encoding and heterogeneous attention to embed topological structures and temporal dynamics. The latter integrates propositional reasoning and first-order reasoning by introducing a reasoning graph that iteratively expands to find the answer. A forward message-passing mechanism is also proposed to update node representations, and their propositional and first-order attention scores. Experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",
