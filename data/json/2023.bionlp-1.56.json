  "abstract": "We describe the participation of team e-Health CSIRO in the BioNLP RadSum task of 2023. This task aims to develop automatic summarisation methods for radiology. The subtask that we participated in was multimodal; the impression section of a report was to be summarised from a given findings section and set of Chest X-rays (CXRs) of a subjectâ€™s study. For our method, we adapted an encoder-to-decoder model for CXR report generation to the subtask. e-Health CSIRO placed seventh amongst the participating teams with a RadGraph ER F1 score of 23.9.",
