  "abstract": "The paper presents two distinct approaches to Task 6 of the SMM4Hâ€™24 workshop: extracting self-reported exact age information from social media posts across platforms. This research task focuses on developing methods for automatically extracting self-reported ages from posts on two prominent social media platforms: Twitter (now X) and Reddit. The work leverages two ways, one Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 Large Language Model (LLM) and another pre-trained language model BERTweet, to achieve robust and generalizable age classification, surpassing limitations of existing methods that rely on predefined age groups. The proposed models aim to advance the automatic extraction of self-reported exact ages from social media posts, enabling more nuanced analyses and insights into user demographics across different platforms.",
