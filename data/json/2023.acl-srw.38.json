  "abstract": "This study addresses the automatic generation of distractors for English fill-in-the-blank exercises in the entrance examinations for Japanese universities. While previous studies applied the same method to all questions, actual entrance examinations have multiple question types that reflect the purpose of the questions. Therefore, we define three types of questions (grammar, function word, and context) and propose a method to generate distractors according to the characteristics of each question type. Experimental results on 500 actual questions show the effectiveness of the proposed method for both automatic and manual evaluation.",
