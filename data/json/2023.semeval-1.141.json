  "abstract": "In this system paper, we describe our submission for the 11th task of SemEval2023: Learning with Disagreements, or Le-Wi-Di for short. In the task, the assumption that there is a single gold label in NLP tasks such as hate speech or misogyny detection is challenged, and instead the opinions of multiple annotators are considered. The goal is instead to capture the agreements/disagreements of the annotators. For our system, we utilize the capabilities of modern large-language models as our backbone and investigate various techniques built on top, such as ensemble learning, multi-task learning, or Gaussian processes. Our final submission shows promising results and we achieve an upper-half finish.",
