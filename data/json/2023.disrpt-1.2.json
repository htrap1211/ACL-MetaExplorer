  "abstract": "This paper introduces DiscoFlan, a multilingual discourse relation classifier submitted for DISRPT 2023. Our submission represents the first attempt at building a multilingual discourse relation classifier for the DISRPT 2023 shared task. By our model addresses the issue to mismatches caused by hallucination in a seq2seq model by utilizing the label distribution information for label generation. In contrast to the previous state-of-the-art model, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features in computing the discourse relation classes. Furthermore, we propose a novel label generation mechanism that anchors the labels to a fixed set by selectively enhancing training on the decoder model. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses the current state-of-the-art performance in 11 out of the 26 datasets considered, however the submitted model compatible with provided evaluation scripts is better in 7 out of 26 considered datasets, while demonstrating competitive results in the rest. Overall, DiscoFlan showcases promising advancements in multilingual discourse relation classification for the DISRPT 2023 shared task.",
