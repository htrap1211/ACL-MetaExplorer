  "abstract": "This study analyzes the verses of the Rigveda, the oldest Sanskrit text, from a metrical perspective. Based on metrical structures, the verses are represented by four elements: light syllables, heavy syllables, word boundaries, and line boundaries. As a result, it became evident that among verses traditionally categorized under the same metrical name, there are those forming distinct clusters. Furthermore, the study reveals commonalities in metrical structures, such as similar metrical patterns grouping together despite differences in the number of lines. Going forward, it is anticipated that this methodology will enable comparisons across multiple languages within the Indo-European language family.",
