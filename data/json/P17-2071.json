  "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of temporal word analogies: pairs of words which occupy the same semantic space at different points in time. One well-known property of word embeddings is that they are able to effectively model traditional word analogies (‚Äúwordw1is to wordw2as wordw3is to wordw4‚Äù) through vector addition. Here, I show that temporal word analogies (‚Äúwordw1at timetùõºis like wordw2at timetùõΩ‚Äù) can effectively be modeled with diachronic word embeddings, provided that the independent embedding spaces from each time period are appropriately transformed into a common vector space. When applied to a diachronic corpus of news articles, this method is able to identify temporal word analogies such as ‚ÄúRonald Reagan in 1987 is like Bill Clinton in 1997‚Äù, or ‚ÄúWalkman in 1987 is like iPod in 2007‚Äù.",
