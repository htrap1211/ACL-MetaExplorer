  "abstract": "The recent release of the AfriSenti-SemEval shared Task 12 has made available 14 new datasets annotated for sentiment analysis on African Languages. We proposed and evaluated two approaches to this task, Delta TF-IDF, and a proposed Language-Specific Model Fusion Algorithm using Language Identification, both of which produced comparable or better classification performance than the current state-of-art models on this task: AfriBERTa, AfroXLMR, and AfroLM.",
