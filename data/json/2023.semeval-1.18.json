  "abstract": "Multimodal ambiguity is a challenge for understanding text and images. Large pre-trained models have reached a high level of quality already. This paper presents an implementation for solving a image disambiguation task relying solely on the knowledge captured in multimodal and language models. Within the task 1 of SemEval 2023 (Visual Word Sense Disambiguation), this approach managed to achieve an MRR of 0.738 using CLIP-Large and the OPT model for generating text. Applying a generative model to create more text given a phrase with an ambiguous word leads to an improvement of our results. The performance gain from a bigger language model is larger than the performance gain from using the lager CLIP model.",
