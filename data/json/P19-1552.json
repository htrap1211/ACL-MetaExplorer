  "abstract": "Although the proper use of idioms can enhance the elegance of writing, the active use of various expressions is a challenge because remembering idioms is difficult. In this study, we address the problem of idiom recommendation by leveraging a neural machine translation framework, in which we suppose that idioms are written with one pseudo target language. Two types of real-life datasets are collected to support this study. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves promising performance compared with other baseline methods.",
