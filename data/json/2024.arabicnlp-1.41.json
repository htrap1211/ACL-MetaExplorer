  "abstract": "Intent detection, also called intent classification or recognition, is an NLP technique to comprehend the purpose behind user utterances. This paper focuses on Multi-dialect Arabic intent detection in banking, utilizing the ArBanking77 dataset. Our method employs an ensemble of fine-tuned BERT-based models, integrating contrastive loss for training. To enhance generalization to diverse Arabic dialects, we augment the ArBanking77 dataset, originally in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Palestinian, with additional dialects such as Egyptian, Moroccan, and Saudi, among others. Our approach achieved an F1-score of 0.8771, ranking first in subtask-1 of the AraFinNLP shared task 2024.",
