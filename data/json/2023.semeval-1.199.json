  "abstract": "Visual-Word Sense Disambiguation (V-WSD) entails resolving the linguistic ambiguity in a text by selecting a clarifying image from a set of (potentially misleading) candidates. In this paper, we address V-WSD using a state-of-the-art Image-Text Retrieval system, namely CLIP. We propose to alleviate the linguistic ambiguity across multiple domains and languages via text and image augmentation. To augment the textual content we rely on back-translation with the aid of a variety of auxiliary languages. The approach based on finetuning CLIP on the full phrases is effective in accurately disambiguating words and incorporating back-translation enhance the systemâ€™s robustness and performance on the test samples written in Indo-European languages.",
