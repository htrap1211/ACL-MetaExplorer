  "abstract": "Classifying temporal relations between a pair of events is crucial to natural language understanding and a well-known natural language processing task. Given a document and two event mentions, the task is aimed at finding which one started first. We propose an efficient approach for temporal relation classification (TRC) using a boolean question answering (QA) model which we fine-tune on questions that we carefully design based on the TRC annotation guidelines, thereby mimicking the way human annotators approach the task. Our new QA-based TRC model outperforms previous state-of-the-art results by 2.4%.",
