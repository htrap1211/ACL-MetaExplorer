  "abstract": "This work describes the participation of the MLLP-VRAIN research group in the two shared tasks of the IWSLT 2022 conference: Simultaneous Speech Translation and Speech-to-Speech Translation. We present our streaming-ready ASR, MT and TTS systems for Speech Translation and Synthesis from English into German. Our submission combines these systems by means of a cascade approach paying special attention to data preparation and decoding for streaming inference.",
