  "abstract": "Speaker diarization is a critical task in the field of computer science, aiming to assign timestamps and speaker labels to audio segments. The aim of these tests in this Publication is to find a pretrained speaker diarization pipeline capable of distinguishing dialectal speakers from each other and an explorer. To achieve this, three pipelines, namely Pyannote, CLEAVER and NeMo, are tested and compared, across various segmentation and parameterization strategies. The study considers multiple scenarios, such as the impact of threshold values, overlap handling, and minimum duration parameters, on classification accuracy. Additionally, this study aims to create a dataset for German dialect identification (DID) based on the findings from this research.",
