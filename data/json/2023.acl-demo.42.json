  "abstract": "Heterogenity of data-to-text generation datasets limits the research on data-to-text generation systems. We present TabGenie â€“ a toolkit which enables researchers to explore, preprocess, and analyze a variety of data-to-text generation datasets through the unified framework of table-to-text generation. In TabGenie, all inputs are represented as tables with associated metadata. The tables can be explored through a web interface, which also provides an interactive mode for debugging table-to-text generation, facilitates side-by-side comparison of generated system outputs, and allows easy exports for manual analysis. Furthermore, TabGenie is equipped with command line processing tools and Python bindings for unified dataset loading and processing. We release TabGenie as a PyPI package and provide its open-source code and a live demo athttps://github.com/kasnerz/tabgenie.",
