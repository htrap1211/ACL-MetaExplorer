  "abstract": "This paper describes our submission to the SemEval 2023 multilingual tweet intimacy analysis shared task. The goal of the task was to assess the level of intimacy of Twitter posts in ten languages. The proposed approach consists of several steps. First, we perform in-domain pre-training to create a language model adapted to Twitter data. In the next step, we train an ensemble of regression models to expand the training set with pseudo-labeled examples. The extended dataset is used to train the final solution. Our method was ranked first in five out of ten language subtasks, obtaining the highest average score across all languages.",
