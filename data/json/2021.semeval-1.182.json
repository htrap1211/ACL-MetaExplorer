  "abstract": "This paper describes our approach for Task 9 of SemEval 2021: Statement Verification and Evidence Finding with Tables. We participated in both subtasks, namely statement verification and evidence finding. For the subtask of statement verification, we extend the TAPAS model to adapt to the ‘unknown’ class of statements by finetuning it on an augmented version of the task data. For the subtask of evidence finding, we finetune the DistilBERT model in a Siamese setting.",
