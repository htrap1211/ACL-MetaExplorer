  "abstract": "Arabic social media platforms are increasingly using propaganda to deceive or influence people. This propaganda is often spread through multimodal content, such as memes. While substantial research has addressed the automatic detection of propaganda in English content, this paper presents the MODOS teamâ€™s participation in the Arabic Multimodal Propagandistic Memes Classification shared task. Our system deploys the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and CLIP for image representation and ARABIAN-GPT embeddings for text. Then, we employ LSTM encoders followed by a weighted fusion strategy to perform binary classification. Our system achieved competitive performance in distinguishing between propagandistic and non-propagandistic memes, scored 0.7290 macro F1, and ranked 6th among the participants.",
