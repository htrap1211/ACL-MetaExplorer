  "abstract": "Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) (Banarescu et al., 2013) is a framework for semantic dependencies that encodes its rooted and directed acyclic graphs in a format called PENMAN notation. The format is simple enough that users of AMR data often write small scripts or libraries for parsing it into an internal graph representation, but there is enough complexity that these users could benefit from a more sophisticated and well-tested solution. The open-source Python library Penman provides a robust parser, functions for graph inspection and manipulation, and functions for formatting graphs into PENMAN notation. Many functions are also available in a command-line tool, thus extending its utility to non-Python setups.",
