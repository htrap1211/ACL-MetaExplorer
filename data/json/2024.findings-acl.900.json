  "abstract": "This paper introduces the Database Querying and Reasoning Dataset for Question Answering (DBQR-QA), aimed at addressing the gap in current question-answering (QA) research by emphasizing the essential processes of database querying and reasoning to answer questions. Specifically designed to accommodate sequential questions and multi-hop queries, DBQR-QA more accurately mirrors the dynamics of real-world information retrieval and analysis, with a particular focus on the financial reports of US companies. The dataset’s construction, the challenges encountered during its development, the performance of large language models on this dataset, and a human evaluation are thoroughly discussed to illustrate the dataset’s complexity and highlight future research directions in querying and reasoning tasks.",
