  "abstract": "In this paper, we present the KU x Upstage teamâ€™s submission for the Special Task on Formality Control on Spoken Language Translation, which involves translating English into four languages with diverse grammatical formality markers. Our methodology comprises two primary components: 1) a language-specific data-driven approach, and 2) the generation of synthetic data through the employment of large-scale language models and empirically-grounded prompt engineering. By adapting methodologies and models to accommodate the unique linguistic properties of each language, we observe a notable enhancement in performance relative to the baseline, substantiating the heightened efficacy of data-driven approaches. Moreover, our devised prompt engineering strategy yields superior synthetic translation instances.",
