  "abstract": "International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding is the task of assigning a patientâ€™s electronic health records into standardized codes, which is crucial for enhancing medical services and reducing healthcare costs. In Korea, automatic Korean Standard Classification of Diseases (KCD) coding has been hindered by limited resources, differences in ICD systems, and language-specific characteristics. Therefore, we construct the Korean Dataset for Automatic KCD coding (KoDAK) by collecting and preprocessing Korean clinical documents. In addition, we propose a tokenization method optimized for Korean clinical documents. Our experiments show that our proposed method outperforms Korean Medical BERT (KM-BERT) in Macro-F1 performance by 0.14%p while using fewer model parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness in Korean clinical documents.",
