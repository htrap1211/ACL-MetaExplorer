  "abstract": "This paper describes an approach to automat- ically close the knowledge gap of Clickbait- Posts via a transformer model trained for Question-Answering, augmented by a task- specific post-processing step. This was part of the SemEval 2023 Clickbait shared task (Frbe et al., 2023a) - specifically task 2. We devised strategies to improve the existing model to fit the task better, e.g. with different special mod- els and a post-processor tailored to different inherent challenges of the task. Furthermore, we explored the possibility of expanding the original training data by using strategies from Heuristic Labeling and Semi-Supervised Learn- ing. With those adjustments, we were able to improve the baseline by 9.8 percentage points to a BLEU-4 score of 48.0%.",
