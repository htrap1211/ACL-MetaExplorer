  "abstract": "The paper presents a generic approach to the supervised sentiment analysis of social media content in Slavic languages. The method proposes translating the documents from the original language to English with Googleâ€™s Neural Translation Model. The resulted texts are then converted to vectors by averaging the vectorial representation of words derived from a pre-trained Word2Vec English model. Testing the approach with several machine learning methods on Polish, Slovenian and Croatian Twitter datasets returns up to 86% of classification accuracy on the out-of-sample data.",
