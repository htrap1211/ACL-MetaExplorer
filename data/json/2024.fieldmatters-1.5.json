  "abstract": "Moklen, a tonal Austronesian language spoken in Thailand, exhibits two tones with unbalanced distributions. We employed machine learning techniques for time-series classification to investigate its acoustic properties. Our analysis reveals that a synergy between pitch and vowel quality is crucial for tone distinction, as the model trained with these features achieved the highest accuracy.",
