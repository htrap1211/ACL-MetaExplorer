  "abstract": "In electronic health records, text data is considered a valuable resource as it complements a medical history and may contain information that cannot be easily included in tables. But why does the inclusion of clinical texts as additional input into multimodal models, not always significantly improve the performance of medical decision-support systems? Explainable AI (XAI) might provide the answer. We examine which information in text and structured data influences the performance of models in the context of multimodal decision support for biomedical tasks. Using data from an intensive care unit and targeting a mortality prediction task, we compare information that has been considered relevant by XAI methods to the opinion of a physician.",
