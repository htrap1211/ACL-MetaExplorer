  "abstract": "This paper describes the participation of the RCLN team at the Visual Word Sense Disambiguation task at SemEval 2023. The participation was focused on the use of CLIP as a base model for the matching between text and images with additional information coming from captions generated from images and the generation of images from the prompt text using Stable Diffusion. The results we obtained are not particularly good, but interestingly enough, we were able to improve over the CLIP baseline in Italian by recurring simply to the generated images.",
