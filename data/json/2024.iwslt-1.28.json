  "abstract": "The paper describes our submission for the unconstrained track of ‘Dialectal and Low-Resource Task’ proposed in IWSLT-2024. We designed cascaded Speech Translation systems for the language pairs Marathi-Hindi and Bhojpuri-Hindi utilising and fine-tuning different pre-trained models for carrying out Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT).",
