  "abstract": "Tabular data analysis is performed everyday across various domains. It requires an accurate understanding of field semantics to correctly operate on table fields and find common patterns in daily analysis. In this paper, we introduce the AnaMeta dataset, a collection of 467k tables with derived supervision labels for four types of commonly used field metadata: measure/dimension dichotomy, common field roles, semantic field type, and default aggregation function. We evaluate a wide range of models for inferring metadata as the benchmark. We also propose a multi-encoder framework, called KDF, which improves the metadata understanding capability of tabular models by incorporating distribution and knowledge information. Furthermore, we propose four interfaces for incorporating field metadata into downstream analysis tasks.",
