  "abstract": "This paper describes our participation in the Third SIGMORPHON Shared Task on Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion (Low-Resource and Cross-Lingual) (McCarthy et al.,2022). Our models rely on different sequence labelling methods. The main model predicts multiple phonemes from each grapheme and is trained using CTC loss (Graves et al., 2006). We find that sequence labelling methods yield worse performance than the baseline when enough data is available, but can still be used when very little data is available. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alignments learned by the sequence labelling models can be easily inspected.",
