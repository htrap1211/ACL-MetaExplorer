  "abstract": "As the world regains its footing following the COVID-19 pandemic, academia is striving to consolidate the gains made in students’ education experience. New technologies such as video-based learning have shown some early improvement in student learning and engagement. In this paper, we present ORBITS predictive engine at YOURIKA company, a video-based student support platform powered by knowledge tracing. In an exploratory case study of one master’s level Speech Processing course at the Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) in Abu Dhabi, half the students used the system while the other half did not. Student qualitative feedback was universally positive and compared the system favorably against current available methods. These findings support the use of artificial intelligence techniques to improve the student learning experience.",
