  "abstract": "This paper describes our submission to theSemEval 2023 Task 3 on two subtasks: detectingpersuasion techniques and framing. Bothsubtasks are multi-label classification problems. We present a set of experiments, exploring howto get robust performance across languages usingpre-trained RoBERTa models. We test differentoversampling strategies, a strategy ofadding textual features from predictions obtainedwith related models, and present bothinconclusive and negative results. We achievea robust ranking across languages and subtaskswith our best ranking being nr. 1 for Subtask 3on Spanish.",
