  "abstract": "Incomplete utterance rewriting (IUR) aims to restore the incomplete utterance with sufficient context information for comprehension. This paper introduces a simple yet efficient IUR method. Different from prior studies, we first employ only one-layerMLP architecture to mine latent semantic information between joint utterances forIURtask (MIUR). After that, we conduct a joint feature matrix to predict the token type and thus restore the incomplete utterance. The well-designed network and simple architecture make our method significantly superior to existing methods in terms of quality and inference speedOur code is available athttps://github.com/IMU-MachineLearningSXD/MIUR.",
