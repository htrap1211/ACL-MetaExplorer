  "abstract": "Style transfer is the task of paraphrasing text into a target-style domain while retaining the content. Unsupervised approaches mainly focus on training a generator to rewrite input sentences. In this work, we assume that text styles are determined by only a small proportion of words; therefore, rewriting sentences via generative models may be unnecessary. As an alternative, we consider style transfer as a sequence tagging task. Specifically, we use edit operations (i.e., deletion, insertion and substitution) to tag words in an input sentence. We train a classifier and a language model to score tagged sequences and build a conditional random field. Finally, the optimal path in the conditional random field is used as the output. The results of experiments comparing models indicate that our proposed model exceeds end-to-end baselines in terms of accuracy on both sentiment and style transfer tasks with comparable or better content preservation.",
