  "abstract": "This paper describes the system used for detecting humor in text. The system developed by the team TECHSSN uses binary classification techniques to classify the text. The data undergoes preprocessing and is given to ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT), a modification of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The model is re-trained and the weights are learned for the dataset. This system was developed for the task 7 of the competition, SemEval 2021.",
