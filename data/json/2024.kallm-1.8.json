  "abstract": "Large-scale knowledge graph construction remains infeasible since it requires significant human-expert involvement. Further complications arise when building graphs from domain-specific data due to their unique vocabularies and associated contexts. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of open-source large language models (LLMs), such as Llama-2 and Llama-3, to extract facts from domain-specific Maintenance Short Texts (MSTs). We employ an approach which combines ontology-guided triplet extraction and in-context learning. By using only 20 semantically similar examples with the Llama-3-70B-Instruct model, we achieve performance comparable to previous methods that relied on fine-tuning techniques like SpERT and REBEL. This indicates that domain-specific fact extraction can be accomplished through inference alone, requiring minimal labeled data. This opens up possibilities for effective and efficient semi-automated knowledge graph construction for domain-specific data.",
