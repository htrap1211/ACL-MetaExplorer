  "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel ensemble approach that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and LightGBM to enhance personality prediction based on the personality Big 5 model. By integrating BERT embeddings from user essays with knowledge graph-derived embeddings, our method accurately captures rich semantic and relational information. Additionally, a special loss function that combines Mean Squared Error (MSE), Pearson correlation loss, and contrastive loss to improve model performance is introduced. The proposed ensemble model, made of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and LightGBM, demonstrates superior performance over other models, with significant improvements in prediction accuracy for the Big Five personality traits achieved. Our system officially ranked2ndat the Track 4: PER track.",
