  "abstract": "Ottoman Turkish, as a historical variant of modern Turkish, suffers from a scarcity of available corpora and NLP models. This paper outlines our pioneering endeavors to address this gap by constructing a clean text corpus of Ottoman Turkish materials. We detail the challenges encountered in this process and offer potential solutions. Additionally, we present a case study wherein the created corpus is employed in continual pre-training of BERTurk, followed by evaluation of the modelâ€™s performance on the named entity recognition task for Ottoman Turkish. Preliminary experimental results suggest the effectiveness of our corpus in adapting existing models developed for modern Turkish to historical Turkish.",
