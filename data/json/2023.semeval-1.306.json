  "abstract": "Transformer language models are now a solid baseline for Named Entity Recognition and can be significantly improved by leveraging complementary resources, either by integrating external knowledge or by annotating additional data. In a preliminary step, this work presents experiments on fine-tuning transformer models. Then, a set of experiments has been conducted with a Wikipedia-based reclassification system. Additionally, we conducted a small annotation campaign on the Farsi language to evaluate the impact of additional data. These two methods with complementary resources showed improvements compared to fine-tuning only.",
