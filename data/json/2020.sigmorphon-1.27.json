  "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for the joint optimization of constraint weights and symbol activations within the Gradient Symbolic Computation (GSC) framework. The set of grammars representable in GSC is proven to be a subset of those representable with lexically-scaled faithfulness constraints. This fact is then used to recast the problem of learning constraint weights and symbol activations in GSC as a quadratically-constrained version of learning lexically-scaled faithfulness grammars. This results in an optimization problem that can be solved using Sequential Quadratic Programming.",
