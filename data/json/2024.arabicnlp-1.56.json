  "abstract": "We present an overview of the FIGNEWSshared task, organized as part of the Arabic-NLP 2024 conference co-located with ACL2024. The shared task addresses bias and pro-paganda annotation in multilingual news posts.We focus on the early days of the Israel War onGaza as a case study. The task aims to fostercollaboration in developing annotation guide-lines for subjective tasks by creating frame-works for analyzing diverse narratives high-lighting potential bias and propaganda. In aspirit of fostering and encouraging diversity,we address the problem from a multilingualperspective, namely within five languages: En-glish, French, Arabic, Hebrew, and Hindi. Atotal of 17 teams participated in two annota-tion subtasks: bias (16 teams) and propaganda(6 teams). The teams competed in four evalua-tion tracks: guidelines development, annotationquality, annotation quantity, and consistency.Collectively, the teams produced 129,800 datapoints. Key findings and implications for thefield are discussed.",
