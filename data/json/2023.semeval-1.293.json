  "abstract": "This paper describes a multilingual persuasion detection system that incorporates persuasion technique attributes for a multi-label classification task. The proposed method has two advantages. First, it combines persuasion features with a sequence classification transformer to classify persuasion techniques. Second, it is a language agnostic approach that supports a total of 100 languages, guaranteed by the multilingual transformer module and the Google translator interface. We found that our persuasion system outperformed the SemEval baseline in all languages except zero shot prediction languages, which did not constitute the main focus of our research. With the highest F1-Micro score of 0.45, Italian achieved the eighth position on the leaderboard.",
