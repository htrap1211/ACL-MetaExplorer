  "abstract": "In this paper, we present our teamâ€™s involvement in Task 6: LegalEval: Understanding Legal Texts. The task comprised three subtasks, and we focus on subtask A: Rhetorical Roles prediction. Our approach included experimenting with pre-trained embeddings and refining them with statistical and neural classifiers. We provide a thorough examination ofour experiments, solutions, and analysis, culminating in our best-performing model and current progress. We achieved a micro F1 score of 0.6133 on the test data using fine-tuned LegalBERT embeddings.",
