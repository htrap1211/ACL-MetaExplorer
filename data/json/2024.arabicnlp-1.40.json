  "abstract": "This paper presents our results for the Arabic Financial NLP (AraFinNLP) shared task at the Second Arabic Natural Language Processing Conference (ArabicNLP 2024). We participated in the first sub-task, Multi-dialect Intent Detection, which focused on cross-dialect intent detection in the banking domain. Our approach involved fine-tuning an encoder-only T5 model, generating synthetic data, and model ensembling. Additionally, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset, addressing annotation errors and problematic translations. Our model was ranked third in the shared task, achieving a F1-score of 0.871.",
