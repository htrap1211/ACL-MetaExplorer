  "abstract": "This paper reports on the performance of SRCBâ€™s system in the Social Media Mining for Health (#SMM4H) 2024 Shared Task 1: extraction and normalization of adverse drug events (ADEs) in English tweets. We develop a system composed of an ADE extraction module and an ADE normalization module which furtherly includes a retrieval module and a filtering module. To alleviate the data imbalance and other issues introduced by the dataset, we employ 4 data augmentation techniques based on Large Language Models (LLMs) across both modules. Our best submission achieves an F1 score of 53.6 (49.4 on the unseen subset) on the ADE normalization task and an F1 score of 52.1 on ADE extraction task.",
