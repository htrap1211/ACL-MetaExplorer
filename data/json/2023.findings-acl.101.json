  "abstract": "Multimedia summarization with multimodal output (MSMO) is a recently explored application in language grounding. It plays an essential role in real-world applications, i.e., automatically generating cover images and titles for news articles or providing introductions to online videos. However, existing methods extract features from the whole video and article and use fusion methods to select the representative one, thus usually ignoring the critical structure and varying semantics with video/document. In this work, we propose a Semantics-Consistent Cross-domain Summarization (SCCS) model based on optimal transport alignment with visual and textual segmentation. Our method first decomposes both videos and articles into segments in order to capture the structural semantics, and then follows a cross-domain alignment objective with optimal transport distance, which leverages multimodal interaction to match and select the visual and textual summary. We evaluated our method on three MSMO datasets, and achieved performance improvement by 8% & 6% of textual and 6.6% &5.7% of video summarization, respectively, which demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in producing high-quality multimodal summaries.",
