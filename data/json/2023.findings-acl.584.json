  "abstract": "Abstractive dialogue summarization has received increasing attention recently. Despite the fact that most of the current dialogue summarization systems are trained to maximize the likelihood of human-written summaries and have achieved significant results, there is still a huge gap in generating high-quality summaries as determined by humans, such as coherence and faithfulness, partly due to the misalignment in maximizing a single human-written summary. To this end, we propose to incorporate different levels of human feedback into the training process. This will enable us to guide the models to capture the behaviors humans care about for summaries. Specifically, we ask humans to highlight the salient information to be included in summaries to provide the local feedback, and to make overall comparisons among summaries in terms of coherence, accuracy, coverage, concise and overall quality, as the global feedback. We then combine both local and global feedback to fine-tune the dialog summarization policy with Reinforcement Learning. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our methods over the state-of-the-art supervised baselines, especially in terms of human judgments.",
