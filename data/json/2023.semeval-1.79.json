  "abstract": "We describe the methods we used for legal text understanding, specifically Task 6 Legal-Eval at SemEval 2023. The outcomes could assist law practitioners and help automate the working process of judicial systems. The shared task defined three main sub-tasks: sub-task A, Rhetorical Roles Prediction (RR); sub-task B, Legal Named Entities Extraction (L-NER); and sub-task C, Court Judgement Prediction with Explanation (CJPE). Our team addressed all three sub-tasks by exploring various Deep Learning (DL) based models. Overall, our teamâ€™s approaches achieved promising results on all three sub-tasks, demonstrating the potential of deep learning-based models in the judicial domain.",
