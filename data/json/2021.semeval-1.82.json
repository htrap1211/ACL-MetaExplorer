  "abstract": "We present the technical report of the system called RS_GV at SemEval-2021 Task 1 on lexical complexity prediction of English words. RS_GV is a neural network using hand-crafted linguistic features in combination with character and word embeddings to predict target wordsâ€™ complexity. For the generation of the hand-crafted features, we set the target words in relation to their senses. RS_GV predicts the complexity well of biomedical terms but it has problems with the complexity prediction of very complex and very simple target words.",
