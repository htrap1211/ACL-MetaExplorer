  "abstract": "The task of clickbait spoiling is: generating a short text that satisfies the curiosity induced by a clickbait post. Clickbait links to a web page and advertises its contents by arousing curiosity instead of providing an informative summary. Previous studies on clickbait spoiling has shown the approach that classifing the type of spoilers is needed, then generating the appropriate spoilers is more effective on the Webis Clickbait Spoiling Corpus 2022 dataset. Our contribution focused on study of the three classes (phrase, passage and multi) and finding appropriate models to generate spoilers foreach class. Results were analysed in each type of spoilers, revealed some reasons of having diversed results in different spoiler types. “passage” type spoiler was identified as the most difficult and the most valuable type of spoiler.",
