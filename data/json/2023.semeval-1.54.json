  "abstract": "The objective of this shared task is to gain an understanding of legal texts, and it is beset with difficulties such as the comprehension of lengthy noisy legal documents, domain specificity as well as the scarcity of annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose a system that employs a hierarchical model and integrates domain-adaptive pretraining, data augmentation, and auxiliary-task learning techniques. Moreover, to enhance generalization and robustness, we ensemble the models that utilize these diverse techniques. Our system ranked first on the RR sub-task and in the middle for the other two sub-tasks.",
