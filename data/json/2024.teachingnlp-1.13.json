  "abstract": "Fuelled by technical advances, the interest in Natural Language Processing in the legal domain has rapidly increased over the last months and years. The design, usage, and testing of domain-specific systems, but also assessing these systems from a legal perspective, needs competencies at the intersection of law and Natural Language Processing. While the demand for such competencies is high among students, only a few law schools, particularly in Europe, teach such competencies. In this paper, we present the design for a Natural Language Processing course for postgraduate law students that is based on the principle of constructive alignment and has proven to be successful over the last three years.",
