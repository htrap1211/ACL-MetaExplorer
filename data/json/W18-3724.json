  "abstract": "When learning Chinese as a foreign language, the learners may have some grammatical errors due to negative migration of their native languages. However, few grammar checking applications have been developed to support the learners. The goal of this paper is to develop a tool to automatically diagnose four types of grammatical errors which are redundant words (R), missing words (M), bad word selection (S) and disordered words (W) in Chinese sentences written by those foreign learners. In this paper, a conventional linear CRF model with specific feature engineering and a LSTM-CRF model are used to solve the CGED (Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis) task. We make some improvement on both models and the submitted results have better performance on false positive rate and accuracy than the average of all runs from CGED2018 for all three evaluation levels.",
