  "abstract": "We present our deep leaning system submitted to MADAR shared task 2 focused on twitter user dialect identification. We develop tweet-level identification models based on GRUs and BERT in supervised and semi-supervised set-tings. We then introduce a simple, yet effective, method of porting tweet-level labels at the level of users. Our system ranks top 1 in the competition, with 71.70% macro F1 score and 77.40% accuracy.",
