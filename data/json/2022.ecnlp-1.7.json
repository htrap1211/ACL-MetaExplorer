  "abstract": "We model productsâ€™ reviews to generate comparative responses consisting of positive and negative experiences regarding the product. Specifically, we generate a single-sentence, comparative response from a given positive and a negative opinion. We contribute the first dataset for this task of Comparative Snippet Generation from contrasting opinions regarding a product, and an analysis of performance of a pre-trained BERT model to generate such snippets.",
