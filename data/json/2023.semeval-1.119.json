  "abstract": "Court Judgement Prediction with Explanation (CJPE) is a task in the field of legal analysis and evaluation, which involves predicting the outcome of a court case based on the available legal text and providing a detailed explanation of the prediction. This is an important task in the legal system as it can aid in decision-making and improve the efficiency of the court process. In this paper, we present a new approach to understanding legal texts, which are normally long documents, based on data-oriented methods. Specifically, we first try to exploit the characteristic of data to understand the legal texts. The output is then used to train the model using the Longformer architecture. Regarding the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated on the sub-task CJPE of the SemEval-2023 Task 6. Accordingly, our method achieves top 1 and top 2 on the classification task and explanation task, respectively. Furthermore, we present several open research issues for further investigations in order to improve the performance in this research field.",
