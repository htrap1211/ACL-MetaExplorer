  "abstract": "This paper presents our approaches for the BioLaySumm 2024 Shared Task. We evaluate two methods for generating lay summaries based on biomedical articles: (1) fine-tuning the Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED) model, and (2) zero-shot and few-shot prompting on GPT-4. In the fine-tuning approach, we individually fine-tune the LED model using two datasets: PLOS and eLife. This process is conducted under two different settings: one utilizing 50% of the training dataset, and the other utilizing the entire 100% of the training dataset. We compare the results of both methods with GPT-4 in zero-shot and few-shot prompting. The experiment results demonstrate that fine-tuning with 100% of the training data achieves better performance than prompting with GPT-4. However, under data scarcity circumstances, prompting GPT-4 seems to be a better solution.",
