  "abstract": "This paper presents the submission by the MeLeL team to the SIGMORPHONâ€“UniMorph Shared Task on Typologically Diverse and Acquisition-Inspired Morphological Inflection Generation Part 3: Models of Acquisition of Inflectional Noun Morphology in Polish, Estonian, and Finnish. This task requires us to produce the word form given a lemma and a grammatical case, while trying to produce the same error-rate as in children. We approach this task with a reduced-size character-based transformer model, multilingual training and an upsampling method to introduce bias.",
