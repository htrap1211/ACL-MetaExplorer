  "abstract": "This paper describes our approach (IIITH) for SemEval-2021 Task 5: HaHackathon: Detecting and Rating Humor and Offense. Our results focus on two major objectives: (i) Effect of task adaptive pretraining on the performance of transformer based models (ii) How does lexical and hurtlex features help in quantifying humour and offense. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of our approach along with comparisions mentioned above.",
