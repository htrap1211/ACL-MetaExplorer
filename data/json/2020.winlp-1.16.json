  "abstract": "In our work, we applied different techniques for the task of genre classification using lyrics. Utilizing our dataset with lyrics of typical genres in Brazil divided into seven classes, we apply some models used in machine learning and deep learning classification tasks. We explore the performance of usual models for text classification using an input in the Portuguese language. We also compare the use of RNN and classic machine learning approaches for text classification, exploring the most used methods in the field.",
