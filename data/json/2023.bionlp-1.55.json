  "abstract": "This paper describes the experiments undertaken and their results as part of the BioNLP 2023 workshop. We took part in Task 1B: Radiology Report Summarization. Multiple runs were submitted for evaluation from solutions utilizing transfer learning from pre-trained transformer models, which were then fine-tuned on MIMIC-III dataset, for abstractive report summarization.",
