  "abstract": "In product reviews, user and product aspects are useful in sentiment analysis. Nevertheless, previous studies mainly focus on modeling user and product aspects without considering the relationship between users and products. The relationship between users and products is typically helpful in estimating the bias of a user toward a product. In this paper, we, therefore, introduce the Graph Neural Network-based model with the pre-trained Language Model (GNNLM), where the relationship between users and products is incorporated. We conducted experiments on three well-known benchmarks for sentiment classification with the user and product information. The experimental results show that the relationship between users and products improves the performance of sentiment analysis. Furthermore, GNNLM achieves state-of-the-art results on yelp-2013 and yelp-2014 datasets.",
