  "abstract": "In this paper, we present a dataset of subjective views (beliefs and attitudes) held by individuals or groups. We analyze the usefulness of the dataset by training a neural classifier that identifies belief-containing sentences that are relevant for our broader project of interestâ€”scientific modeling of complex systems. We also explore and discuss difficulties related to annotation of subjective views and propose ways of addressing them.",
