  "abstract": "We describe our participation on the Multi-evidence Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trial Data (NLI4CT) of SemEvalâ€™23. The organizers provided a collection of clinical trials as training data and a set of statements, which can be related to either a single trial or to a comparison of two trials. The task consisted of two sub-tasks: (i) textual entailment (Task 1) for predicting whether the statement is supported (Entailment) or not (Contradiction) by the corresponding trial(s); and (ii) evidence retrieval (Task 2) for selecting the evidences (sentences in the trials) that support the decision made for Task 1. We built a model based on a sentence-based BERT similarity model which was pre-trained on ClinicalBERT embeddings. Our best results on the official test sets were f-scores of 0.64 and 0.67 for Tasks 1 and 2, respectively.",
