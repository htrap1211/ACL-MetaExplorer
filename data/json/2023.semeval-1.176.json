  "abstract": "Semeval 2023 task 1: VWSD, In this paper, we propose an ensemble of two Neural network systems that ranks 10 images given a word and limited textual context. We have used openAI Clip based models for the English language and multilingual text-to-text translation models for Farsi-to-English and Italian-to-English. Additionally, we propose a system that learns from multilingual bert-base embeddings for text and resnet101 embeddings for the image. Considering all the three languages into account this system has achieved the fourth rank.",
