  "abstract": "Clickbait is the text or a thumbnail image that entices the user to click the accompanying link. Clickbaits employ strategies while deliberately hiding the critical elements of the article and revealing partial information in the title, which arouses sufficient curiosity and motivates the user to click the link. In this work, we identify the kind of spoiler given a clickbait title. We formulate this as a text classification problem. We finetune pretrained transformer models on the title of the post and build models for theclickbait-spoiler classification. We achieve a balanced accuracy of 0.70 which is close to the baseline.",
