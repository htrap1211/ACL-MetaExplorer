  "abstract": "Single Choice exercises constitute a central exercise type for language learning in a learner’s progression from mere implicit exposure through input enhancement to productive language use in open exercises. Distractors that support learning in the individual zone of proximal development should not be derived from static analyses of learner corpora, but rely on dynamic learning analytics based on half-open exercises. We demonstrate how a system’s error diagnosis module can be re-used for automatic and dynamic generation and adaptation of distractors, as well as to inform exercise generation in terms of relevant learning goals and reasonable chunking in Jumbled Sentences exercises.",
