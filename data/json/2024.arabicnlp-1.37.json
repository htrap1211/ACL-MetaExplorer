  "abstract": "Arabic banking intent detection represents a challenging problem across multiple dialects. It imposes generalization difficulties due to the scarcity of Arabic language and its dialects resources compared to English. We propose a methodology that leverages contrastive training to overcome this limitation. We also augmented the data with several dialects using a translation model. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of our approach in capturing linguistic nuances across different Arabic dialects as well as accurately differentiating between banking intents across diverse linguistic landscapes. This would enhance multi-dialect banking services in the Arab world with limited Arabic language resources. Using our proposed method we achieved second place on subtask 1 leaderboard of the AraFinNLP2024 shared task with micro-F1 score of 0.8762 on the test split.",
