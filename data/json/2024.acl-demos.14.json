  "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented question-answering systems combine retrieval techniques with large language models to provide answers that are more accurate and informative. Many existing toolkits allow users to quickly build such systems using off-the-shelf models, but they fall short in supporting researchers and developers to customize the *model training, testing, and deployment process*. We propose LocalRQA, an open-source toolkit that features a wide selection of model training algorithms, evaluation methods, and deployment tools curated from the latest research. As a showcase, we build QA systems using online documentation obtained from Databricks and Faire’s websites. We find 7B-models trained and deployed using LocalRQA reach a similar performance compared to using OpenAI’s text-ada-002 and GPT-4-turbo.",
