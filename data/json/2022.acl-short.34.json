  "abstract": "LM-BFF (CITATION) achieves significant few-shot performance by using auto-generated prompts and adding demonstrations similar to an input example. To improve the approach of LM-BFF, this paper proposesLM-BFF-MSâ€”betterfew-shotfine-tuning oflanguagemodels withmultiplesoft demonstrations by making its further extensions, which include 1) prompts withmultiple demonstrationsbased on automatic generation of multiple label words; and 2)soft demonstration memorywhich consists of multiple sequences ofglobally sharedword embeddings for a similar context. Experiments conducted on eight NLP tasks show that LM-BFF-MS leads to improvements over LM-BFF on five tasks, particularly achieving 94.0 and 90.4 on SST-2 and MRPC, respectively.",
