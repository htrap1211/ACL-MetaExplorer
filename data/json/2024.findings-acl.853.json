  "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph reasoning has emerged as a crucial task for answering time-dependent questions within a knowledge graph (KG).Despite tremendous progress, the present research is impeded by the sparsity of a temporal KG and an over-reliance on simple single-relational reasoning patterns. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MulQuestions, a new temporal KG reasoning benchmark featuring over 200k entities and 960k questions designed to facilitate complex, multi-relational and multi-hop reasoning. Additionally, we propose a new model adept at conducting pattern-aware and time-sensitive reasoning across temporal KGs. The modelâ€™s efficacy is confirmed through rigorous evaluations, showcasing its effectiveness in sparse data conditions and adeptness at handling questions with long reasoning chains. We have made our benchmark and model publicly accessible at [https://anonymous].",
