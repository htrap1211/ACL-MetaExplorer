  "abstract": "Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is widely used in various applications. However, existing ASTE datasets are limited in their ability to represent real-world scenarios, hindering the advancement of research in this area. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, named DMASTE, which is manually annotated to better fit real-world scenarios by providing more diverse and realistic reviews for the task. The dataset includes various lengths, diverse expressions, more aspect types, and more domains than existing datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on DMASTE in multiple settings to evaluate previous ASTE approaches. Empirical results demonstrate that DMASTE is a more challenging ASTE dataset. Further analyses of in-domain and cross-domain settings provide some promising directions for future research.",
