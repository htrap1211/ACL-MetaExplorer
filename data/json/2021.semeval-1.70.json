  "abstract": "In this contribution, we describe the system presented by the PolyU CBS-Comp Team at the Task 1 of SemEval 2021, where the goal was the estimation of the complexity of words in a given sentence context. Our top system, based on a combination of lexical, syntactic, word embeddings and Transformers-derived features and on a Gradient Boosting Regressor, achieves a top correlation score of 0.754 on the subtask 1 for single words and 0.659 on the subtask 2 for multiword expressions.",
