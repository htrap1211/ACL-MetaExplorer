  "abstract": "This paper presents a study on the effectiveness of various approaches for addressing the challenge of multilingual sentiment analysis in low-resource African languages. . The approaches evaluated in the study include Support Vector Machines (SVM), translation, and an ensemble of pre-trained multilingual sentimental models methods. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the performance of each approach based on experimental results. In our findings, we suggest that the ensemble method is the most effective with an F1-Score of 0.68 on the final testing. This system ranked 19 out of 33 participants in the competition.",
