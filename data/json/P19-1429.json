  "abstract": "Event detection systems rely on discrimination knowledge to distinguish ambiguous trigger words and generalization knowledge to detect unseen/sparse trigger words. Current neural event detection approaches focus on trigger-centric representations, which work well on distilling discrimination knowledge, but poorly on learning generalization knowledge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Delta-learning approach to distill discrimination and generalization knowledge by effectively decoupling, incrementally learning and adaptively fusing event representation. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches on unseen/sparse trigger words, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ACE2005 and KBP2017 datasets.",
