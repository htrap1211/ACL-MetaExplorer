  "abstract": "As social media usage continues to rise, the demand for systems to analyze opinions and sentiments expressed in textual data has become more critical. This paper presents our submission to the Stance Detection in Arabic Language Shared Task, in which we evaluated three models: the fine-tuned MARBERT Transformer, the fine-tuned AraBERT Transformer, and an Ensemble of Machine learning Classifiers. Our findings indicate that the MARBERT Transformer outperformed the other models in performance across all targets. In contrast, the Ensemble Classifier, which combines traditional machine learning techniques, demonstrated relatively lower effectiveness.",
