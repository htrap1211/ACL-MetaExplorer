  "abstract": "We present models for lemmatizing and POS-tagging Earlier Egyptian, Coptic and Demotic to test the performance of our pipeline for the ancient languages of Egypt. Of these languages, Demotic and Egyptian are known to be difficult to annotate due to their high extent of ambiguity. We report lemmatization accuracy of 86%, 91% and 99%, and XPOS-tagging accuracy of 89%, 95% and 98% for Earlier Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic, respectively.",
