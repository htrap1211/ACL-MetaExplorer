  "abstract": "Dynamic contextualised word embeddings (DCWEs) represent the temporal semantic variations of words. We propose a method for learning DCWEs by time-adapting a pretrained Masked Language Model (MLM) using time-sensitive templates. Given two snapshotsC1andC2of a corpus taken respectively at two distinct timestampsT1andT2, we first propose an unsupervised method to select (a)pivotterms related to bothC1andC2, and (b)anchorterms that are associated with a specific pivot term in each individual snapshot.We then generate prompts by filling manually compiled templates using the extracted pivot and anchor terms.Moreover, we propose an automatic method to learn time-sensitive templates fromC1andC2, without requiring any human supervision.Next, we use the generated prompts to adapt a pretrained MLM toT2by fine-tuning using those prompts.Multiple experiments show that our proposed method significantly reduces the perplexity of test sentences inC2, outperforming the current state-of-the-art.",
