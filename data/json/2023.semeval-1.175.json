  "abstract": "The web contains an abundance of user- generated content. While this content is useful for many applications, it poses many challenges due to the presence of offensive, biased, and overall toxic language. In this work, we present a system that identifies and classifies sexist content at different levels of granularity. Using transformer-based models, we explore the value of data augmentation, use of ensemble methods, and leverage in-context learning using foundation models to tackle the task. We evaluate the different components of our system both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our best systems achieve an F1 score of 0.84 for the binary classification task aiming to identify whether a given content is sexist or not and 0.64 and 0.47 for the two multi-class tasks that aim to identify the coarse and fine-grained types of sexism present in the given content respectively.",
