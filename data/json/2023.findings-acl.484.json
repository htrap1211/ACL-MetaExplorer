  "abstract": "Morphological analysis is an important research issue in the field of natural language processing. In this study, we propose a context-free morphological analysis task, namely word-level prefix/suffix sense detection, which deals with the ambiguity of sense expressed by prefix/suffix. To research this novel task, we first annotate a corpus with prefixes/suffixes expressing negation (e.g., il-, un-, -less) and then propose a novel few-shot learning approach that applies an input-augmentation prompt to a token-replaced detection pre-training model. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to word-level prefix/suffix negation sense detection.",
