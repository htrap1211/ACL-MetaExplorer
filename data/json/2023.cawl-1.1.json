  "abstract": "Natural language processing is largely focused on written text processing. However, many computational linguists tacitly endorse myths about the nature of writing. We highlight two of these myths—the conflation of language and writing, and the notion that Chinese, Japanese, and Korean writing is ideographic—and suggest how the community can dispel them.",
