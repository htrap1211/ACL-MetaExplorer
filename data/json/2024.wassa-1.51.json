  "abstract": "This paper introduces our submitted systems for WASSA 2024 Shared Task 2: Cross-Lingual Emotion Detection. We implemented a BERT-based classifier and an in-context learning-based system. Our best-performing model, using English Chain of Thought prompts with trigger words, reached 3rd overall with an F1 score of 0.6015. Following the motivation of the shared task, we further analyzed the scalability and transferability of the monolingual English dataset on cross-lingual tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of data quality over quantity. We also found that augmented multilingual data does not necessarily perform better than English monolingual data in cross-lingual tasks. We open-sourced the augmented data and source code of our system for future research.",
