  "abstract": "This paper describes our system and findings for SIGHAN-2024 Shared Task Chinese Dimensional Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (dimABSA). Our team CCIIPLab proposes an Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Span-based (CL-Span) framework to boost the performance of extracting triplets/quadruples and predicting sentiment intensity. We first employ a span-based framework that integrates contextual representations and incorporates rotary position embedding. This approach fully considers the relational information of entire aspect and opinion terms, and enhancing the modelâ€™s understanding of the associations between tokens. Additionally, we utilize contrastive learning to predict sentiment intensities in the valence-arousal dimensions with greater precision. To improve the generalization ability of the model, additional datasets are used to assist training. Experiments have validated the effectiveness of our approach. In the official test results, our system ranked 2nd among the three subtasks.",
