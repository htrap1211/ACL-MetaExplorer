  "abstract": "In a typical call center, only up to 8% of callersleave a Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) surveyresponse at the end of the call, and these tend tobe customers with strongly positive or negativeexperiences. To manage this data sparsity andresponse bias, we outline a predictive CSATdeep learning algorithm that infers CSAT onthe 1-5 scale on inbound calls to the call centerwith minimal latency. The key metric to maximize is the precision for CSAT = 1 (lowestCSAT). We maximize this metric in two ways. First, reframing the problemas a binary class, rather than five-class problem during model fine-tuning, and then mapping binary outcomes back to five classes usingtemperature-scaled model probabilities. Second, using soft labels to represent the classes. Theresult is a production model able to support keycustomer workflows with high accuracy overmillions of calls a month.",
