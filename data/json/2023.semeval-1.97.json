  "abstract": "Social media is a concept developed to link people and make the globe smaller. But it has recently developed into a center for sexist memes that target especially women. As a result, there are more events of hostile actions and harassing remarks present online. In this paper, we introduce our system for the task of online sexism detection, a part of SemEval 2023 task 10. We introduce fine-tuned RoBERTa model to address this specific problem. The efficiency of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by the experimental results reported in this research.",
