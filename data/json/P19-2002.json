  "abstract": "There are a lot of noise texts surrounding a person in modern life. The traditional approach is to use spelling correction, yet the existing solutions are far from perfect. We propose robust to noise word embeddings model, which outperforms existing commonly used models, like fasttext and word2vec in different tasks. In addition, we investigate the noise robustness of current models in different natural language processing tasks. We propose extensions for modern models in three downstream tasks, i.e. text classification, named entity recognition and aspect extraction, which shows improvement in noise robustness over existing solutions.",
