  "abstract": "Textual data are useful for accessing expert information. Yet, since the texts are representative of distinct language uses, it is necessary to build specific corpora in order to be able to design suitable NLP tools. In some domains, such as medical domain, it may be complicated to access the representative textual data and their semantic annotations, while there exists a real need for providing efficient tools and methods. Our paper presents a corpus of clinical cases written in French, and their semantic annotations. Thus, we manually annotated a set of 717 files into four general categories (age, gender, outcome, and origin) for a total number of 2,835 annotations. The values of age, gender, and outcome are normalized. A subset with 70 files has been additionally manually annotated into 27 categories for a total number of 5,198 annotations.",
