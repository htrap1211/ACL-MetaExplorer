  "abstract": "This paper describes the CMU-LTI submission to the SIGMORPHON 2020 Shared Task 0 on typologically diverse morphological inflection. The (unrestricted) submission uses the cross-lingual approach of our last yearâ€™s winning submission (Anastasopoulos and Neubig, 2019), but adapted to use specific transfer languages for each test language. Our system, with fixed non-tuned hyperparameters, achieved a macro-averaged accuracy of 80.65 ranking 20th among 31 systems, but it was still tied for best system in 25 of the 90 total languages.",
