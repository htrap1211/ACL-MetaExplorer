  "abstract": "This paper explains the design of a heterogeneous system that ranked eighth in competition in SemEval2021 Task 8. We analyze ablation experiments and demonstrate how the system components, namely tokenizer, unit identifier, modifier classifier, and language model, affect the overall score. We compare our results to similar experiments from the literature and introduce a grouping algorithm developed in the post-evaluation phase that increased our systemâ€™s overall score, hypothetically elevating our competition rank from eight to six.",
