  "abstract": "Reasoning, a fundamental cognitive process integral to human intelligence, has garnered substantial interest within artificial intelligence.Notably, recent studies have revealed that chain-of-thought prompting significantly enhances LLMâ€™s reasoning capabilities, which attracts widespread attention from both academics and industry.In this paper, we systematically investigate relevant research, summarizing advanced methods through a meticulous taxonomy that offers novel perspectives.Moreover, we delve into the current frontiers and delineate the challenges and future directions, thereby shedding light on future research.Furthermore, we engage in a discussion about open questions.We hope this paper serves as an introduction for beginners and fosters future research.Resources have been made publicly available at https://github.com/zchuz/CoT-Reasoning-Survey",
