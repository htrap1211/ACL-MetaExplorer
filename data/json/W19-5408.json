  "abstract": "We explore different model architectures for the WMT 19 shared task on word-level quality estimation of automatic translation. We start with a model similar to Shef-bRNN, which we modify by using conditional random fields for sequence labelling. Additionally, we use a different approach for labelling gaps and source words. We further develop this model by including features from different sources such as BERT, baseline features for the task and transformer encoders. We evaluate the performance of our models on the English-German dataset for the corresponding shared task.",
