  "abstract": "Creating chatbots to behave like real people is important in terms of believability. Errors in general chatbots and chatbots that follow a rough persona have been studied, but those in chatbots that behave like real people have not been thoroughly investigated. We collected a large amount of user interactions of a generation-based chatbot trained from large-scale dialogue data of a specific character, i.e., target person, and analyzed errors related to that person. We found that person-specific errors can be divided into two types: errors in attributes and those in relations, each of which can be divided into two levels: self and other. The correspondence with an existing taxonomy of errors was also investigated, and person-specific errors that should be addressed in the future were clarified.",
