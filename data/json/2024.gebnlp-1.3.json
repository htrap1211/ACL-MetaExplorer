  "abstract": "Despite concerns that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vectors for reproducing and amplifying social biases such as sexism, transphobia, islamophobia, and racism, there is a lack of work qualitatively analyzinghowsuch patterns of bias are generated by LLMs. We use mixed-methods approaches and apply a feminist, intersectional lens to the problem across two language domains, Swedish and English, by generating narrative texts using LLMs. We find that hegemonic norms are consistently reproduced; dominant identities are often treated as ‘default’; and discussion of identity itself may be considered ‘inappropriate’ by the safety features applied to some LLMs. Due to the differing behaviors of models, depending both on their design and the language they are trained on, we observe that strategies of identifying “bias” must be adapted to individual models and their socio-cultural contexts._Content warning: This research concerns the identification of harms, including stereotyping, denigration, and erasure of minoritized groups. Examples, including transphobic and racist content, are included and discussed._",
