  "abstract": "Each year a large number of early career researchers join the NLP/Computational Linguistics community, with most starting by presenting their research in the *ACL conferences and workshops. While writing a paper that has made it to these venues is one important step, what comes with communicating the outcome is equally important and sets the path to impact of a research outcome. In addition, not all PhD candidates get the chance of being trained for their presentation skills. Research methods courses are not all of the same quality and may not cover scientific communications, and certainly not all are tailored to the NLP community. We are proposing an introductory tutorial that covers a range of different communication skills, including writing, oral presentation (posters and demos), and social media presence. This is to fill in the gap for the researchers who may not have access to research methods courses or other mentors who could help them acquire such skills. The interactive nature of such a tutorial would allow attendees to ask questions and clarifications which would not be possible from reading materials alone.",
