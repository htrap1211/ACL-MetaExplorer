  "abstract": "DA-MSA Machine Translation is a recentchallenge due to the multitude of Arabic dialects and their variations. In this paper, we present our results within the context of Subtask 3 of the NADI-2024 Shared Task(Abdul-Mageed et al., 2024) that is DA-MSA Machine Translation . We utilized the DIALECTS008MSA MADAR corpus (Bouamor et al., 2018),the Emi-NADI corpus for the Emirati dialect (Khered et al., 2023), and we augmented thePalestinian and Jordanian datasets based onNADI 2021. Our approach involves develop013ing sentence-level machine translations fromPalestinian, Jordanian, Emirati, and Egyptiandialects to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).To016 address this challenge, we fine-tuned models such as (Nagoudi et al., 2022)AraT5v2-msa-small, AraT5v2-msa-base, and (Elmadanyet al., 2023)AraT5v2-base-1024 to comparetheir performance. Among these, the AraT5v2-base-1024 model achieved the best accuracy, with a BLEU score of 0.1650 on the develop023ment set and 0.1746 on the test set.",
