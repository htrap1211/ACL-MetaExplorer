  "abstract": "Tense inconsistency frequently occurs in machine translation. However, there are few criteria to assess the modelâ€™s mastery of tense prediction from a linguistic perspective. In this paper, we present a parallel tense test set, containing French-English 552 utterances. We also introduce a corresponding benchmark, tense prediction accuracy. With the tense test set and the benchmark, researchers are able to measure the tense consistency performance of machine translation systems for the first time.",
