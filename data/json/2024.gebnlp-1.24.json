  "abstract": "This study explores the effect of annotatorsâ€™ demographic features on labeling sexist content in social media datasets, specifically focusing on the EXIST dataset, which includes direct sexist messages, reports and descriptions of sexist experiences and stereotypes. We investigate how various demographic backgrounds influence annotation outcomes and examine methods to incorporate these features into BERT-based model training. Our experiments demonstrate that adding demographic information improves performance in detecting sexism and assessing intention of the author.",
