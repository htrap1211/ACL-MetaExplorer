  "abstract": "This paper describes our submission to theSemEvalâ€™21: Task 7- HaHackathon: Detecting and Rating Humor and Offense. In this challenge, we explore intermediate finetuning, backtranslation augmentation, multitask learning, and ensembling of different language models. Curiously, intermediate finetuning and backtranslation do not improve performance, while multitask learning and ensembling do improve performance. We explore why intermediate finetuning and backtranslation do not provide the same benefit as other natural language processing tasks and offer insight into the errors that our model makes. Our best performing system ranks 7th on Task 1bwith an RMSE of 0.5339",
