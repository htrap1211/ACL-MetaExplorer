  "abstract": "Scientific writing involves retrieving, summarizing, and citing relevant papers, which can be time-consuming processes. Although in many workflows these processes are serially linked, there are opportunities for natural language processing (NLP) to provide end-to-end assistive tools. We propose SciLit, a pipeline that automatically recommends relevant papers, extracts highlights, and suggests a reference sentence as a citation of a paper, taking into consideration the user-provided context and keywords. SciLit efficiently recommends papers from large databases of hundreds of millions of papers using a two-stage pre-fetching and re-ranking literature search system that flexibly deals with addition and removal of a paper database. We provide a convenient user interface that displays the recommended papers as extractive summaries and that offers abstractively-generated citing sentences which are aligned with the provided context and which mention the chosen keyword(s). Our assistive tool for literature discovery and scientific writing is available athttps://scilit.vercel.app",
