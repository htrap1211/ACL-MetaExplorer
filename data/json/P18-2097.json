  "abstract": "This paper investigates the construction of a strong baseline based on general purpose sequence-to-sequence models for constituency parsing. We incorporate several techniques that were mainly developed in natural language generation tasks, e.g., machine translation and summarization, and demonstrate that the sequence-to-sequence model achieves the current top-notch parsersâ€™ performance (almost) without requiring any explicit task-specific knowledge or architecture of constituent parsing.",
