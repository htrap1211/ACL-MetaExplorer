  "abstract": "This paper describes our approach to Subtask 1 “News Genre Categorization” of SemEval-2023 Task 3 “Detecting the Category, the Framing, and the Persuasion Techniques in Online News in a Multi-lingual Setup”, which aims to determine whether a given news article is an opinion piece, an objective report, or satirical. We fine-tuned the domain-specific language model POLITICS, which was pre-trained on a large-scale dataset of more than 3.6M English political news articles following ideology-driven pre-training objectives. In order to use it in the multilingual setup of the task, we added as a pre-processing step the translation of all documents into English. Our system ranked among the top systems overall in most language, and ranked 1st on the English dataset.",
