  "abstract": "The rise of memes as a tool for spreading propaganda presents a significant challenge in the current digital environment. In this paper, we outline our work for the ArAIEval Shared Task2 in ArabicNLP 2024. This study introduces a method for identifying propaganda in Arabic memes using a multimodal system that combines textual and visual indicators to enhance the result. Our approach achieves the first place in text classification with Macro-F1 of 78.69%, the third place in image classification with Macro-F1 of 65.92%, and the first place in multimodal classification with Macro-F1 of 80.51%",
