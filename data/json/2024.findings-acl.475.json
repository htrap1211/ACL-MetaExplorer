  "abstract": "To achieve non-parametric NMT domain adaptation,k-Nearest-Neighbor Machine Translation (kNN-MT) constructs an external datastore to store domain-specific translation knowledge, which derives akNN distribution to interpolate the prediction distribution of the NMT model via a linear interpolation coefficientùúÜ. Despite its success,kNN retrieval at each timestep leads to substantial time overhead. To address this issue, dominant studies resort tokNN-MT with adaptive retrieval (kNN-MT-AR), which dynamically estimatesùúÜand skipskNN retrieval ifùúÜis less than a fixed threshold. Unfortunately,kNN-MT-AR does not yield satisfactory results. In this paper, we first conduct a preliminary study to reveal two key limitations ofkNN-MT-AR: 1) the optimization gap leads to inaccurate estimation ofùúÜfor determiningkNN retrieval skipping, and 2) using a fixed threshold fails to accommodate the dynamic demands forkNN retrieval at different timesteps. To mitigate these limitations, we then proposekNN-MT with dynamic retrieval (kNN-MT-DR) that significantly extends vanillakNN-MT in two aspects. Firstly, we equipkNN-MT with a MLP-based classifier for determining whether to skipkNN retrieval at each timestep. Particularly, we explore several carefully-designed scalar features to fully exert the potential of the classifier. Secondly, we propose a timestep-aware threshold adjustment method to dynamically generate the threshold, which further improves the efficiency of our model. Experimental results on the widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our model.",
