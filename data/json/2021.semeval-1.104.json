  "abstract": "This paper presents a word-in-context disambiguation system. The task focuses on capturing the polysemous nature of words in a multilingual and cross-lingual setting, without considering a strict inventory of word meanings. The system applies Natural Language Processing algorithms on datasets from SemEval 2021 Task 2, being able to identify the meaning of words for the languages Arabic, Chinese, English, French and Russian, without making use of any additional mono- or multilingual resources.",
