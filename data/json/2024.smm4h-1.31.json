  "abstract": "This paper describes the work undertaken as part of the SMM4H-2024 shared task, specifically Task 5, which involves the binary classification of English tweets reporting childrenâ€™s medical disorders. The primary objective is to develop a system capable of automatically identifying tweets from users who report their pregnancy and mention children with specific medical conditions, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), delayed speech, or asthma, while distinguishing them from tweets that merely reference a disorder without much context. Our approach leverages advanced natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately classify the tweets. The system achieved an overall F1-score of 0.87, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in addressing the classification challenge posed by this task.",
