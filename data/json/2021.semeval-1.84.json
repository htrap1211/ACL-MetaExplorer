  "abstract": "In this paper we describe our participation in the Lexical Complexity Prediction (LCP) shared task of SemEval 2021, which involved predicting subjective ratings of complexity for English single words and multi-word expressions, presented in context. Our approach relies on a combination of distributional models, both context-dependent and context-independent, together with behavioural norms and lexical resources.",
