  "abstract": "In recent years, we have seen many Transformer based models being created to address Dialog Summarization problem. While there has been a lot of work on understanding how these models stack against each other in summarizing regular conversations such as the ones found in DialogSum dataset, there havenâ€™t been many analysis of these models on Clinical Dialog Summarization. In this article, we describe our solution to MEDIQA-Chat 2023 Shared Tasks as part of ACL-ClinicalNLP 2023 workshop which benchmarks some of the popular Transformer Architectures such as BioBart, Flan-T5, DialogLED, and OpenAI GPT3 on the problem of Clinical Dialog Summarization. We analyse their performance on two tasks - summarizing short conversations and long conversations. In addition to this, we also benchmark two popular summarization ensemble methods and report their performance.",
