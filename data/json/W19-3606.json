  "abstract": "Recognizing the arrow of time in the context of paragraphs in short stories is a challenging task. i.e., given only two paragraphs (excerpted from a random position in a short story), determining which comes first and which comes next is a difficult task even for humans. In this paper, we have collected and curated a novel dataset for tackling this challenging task. We have shown that a pre-trained BERT architecture achieves reasonable accuracy on the task, and outperforms RNN-based architectures.",
