  "abstract": "Considerable efforts have been invested in augmenting the role-playing proficiency of open-source large language models (LLMs) by emulating proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless, we posit that LLMs inherently harbor role-play capabilities, owing to the extensive knowledge of characters and potential dialogues ingrained in their vast training corpora. Thus, we introduce Ditto, the first self-alignment method for role-play, which encourages an instruction-following LLM to simulate role-play dialogues as a variant of reading comprehension, and creates a role-play training set comprising 4000 characters, surpassing the scale of currently available datasets by tenfold regarding the number of roles. Subsequently, we fine-tune the LLM using this self-generated dataset to augment its role-playing capabilities. Upon evaluating our meticulously constructed role-play benchmark and the roleplay subset of MT-Bench, Ditto, in various parameter scales, consistently maintains a consistent role identity and provides accurate role-specific knowledge in multi-turn role-play conversations, outperforming all open-source role-play baselines. Furthermore, we present the first cross-supervision role-play experiment, revealing that the role-play styles can be easily acquired, while the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs confine the knowledge within role-play.",
