  "abstract": "This paper describes Humor-BERT, a set of BERT Large based models that we used in the SemEval-2021 Task 7: Detecting and Rating Humor and Offense. It presents pre and post processing techniques, variable threshold learning, meta learning and Ensemble approach to solve various sub-tasks that were part of the challenge. We also present a comparative analysis of various models we tried. Our method was ranked 4th in Humor Controversy Detection, 8th in Humor Detection, 19th in Average Offense Score prediction and 40th in Average Humor Score prediction globally. F1 score obtained for Humor classification was 0.9655 and for Controversy detection it was 0.6261. Our user name on the leader board is ThisIstheEnd and team name is EndTimes.",
