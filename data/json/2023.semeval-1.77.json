  "abstract": "This paper describes the participation of the research laboratory MIND, at the University of Milano-Bicocca, in the SemEval 2023 task related to Learning With Disagreements (Le-Wi-Di). The main goal is to identify the level of agreement/disagreement from a collection of textual datasets with different characteristics in terms of style, language and task. The proposed approach is grounded on the hypothesis that the disagreement between annotators could be grasped by the uncertainty that a model, based on several linguistic characteristics, could have on the prediction of a given gold label.",
