  "abstract": "In intelligent language tutoring systems, student dashboards should display the learning progress and performance and support the navigation through the learning content. Designing an interface that transparently offers information on studentsâ€™ learning in relation to specific learning targets while linking to the overarching functional goal, that motivates and organizes the practice in current foreign language teaching, is challenging. This becomes even more difficult in systems that adaptively expose students to different learning material and individualize system interactions. If such a system is used in an ecologically valid setting of blended learning, this generates additional requirements to incorporate the needs of students and teachers for control and customizability.We present the conceptual design of a student dashboard for a task-based, user-adaptive intelligent language tutoring system intended for use in real-life English classes in secondary schools. We highlight the key challenges and spell out open questions for future research.",
