  "abstract": "SemEval-2023â€™s Task 1, Visual Word Sense Disambiguation, a task about text semantics and visual semantics, selecting an image from a list of candidates, that best exhibits a given target word in a small context. We tried several methods, including the image captioning method and CLIP methods, and submitted our predictions in the competition for this task. This paper describes the methods we used and their performance and provides an analysis and discussion of the performance.",
