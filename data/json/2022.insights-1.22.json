  "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce and justify a new task—causal link extraction based on beliefs—and do a qualitative analysis of the ability of a large language model—InstructGPT-3—to generate implicit consequences of beliefs. With the language model-generated consequences being promising, but not consistent, we propose directions of future work, including data collection, explicit consequence extraction using rule-based and language modeling-based approaches, and using explicitly stated consequences of beliefs to fine-tune or prompt the language model to produce outputs suitable for the task.",
