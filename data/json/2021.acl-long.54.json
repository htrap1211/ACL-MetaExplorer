  "abstract": "Inferring social relations from dialogues is vital for building emotionally intelligent robots to interpret human language better and act accordingly. We model the social network as an And-or Graph, named SocAoG, for the consistency of relations among a group and leveraging attributes as inference cues. Moreover, we formulate a sequential structure prediction task, and propose an𝛼-𝛽-𝛾strategy to incrementally parse SocAoG for the dynamic inference upon any incoming utterance: (i) an𝛼process predicting attributes and relations conditioned on the semantics of dialogues, (ii) a𝛽process updating the social relations based on related attributes, and (iii) a𝛾process updating individual’s attributes based on interpersonal social relations. Empirical results on DialogRE and MovieGraph show that our model infers social relations more accurately than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study shows the three processes complement each other, and the case study demonstrates the dynamic relational inference.",
