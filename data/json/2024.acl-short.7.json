  "abstract": "Whether embedding spaces use all their dimensions equally, i.e., whether they are isotropic, has been a recent subject of discussion. Evidence has been accrued both for and against enforcing isotropy in embedding spaces. In the present paper, we stress that isotropy imposes requirements on the embedding space that are not compatible with the presence of clustersâ€”which also negatively impacts linear classification objectives. We demonstrate this fact both empirically and mathematically and use it to shed light on previous results from the literature.",
