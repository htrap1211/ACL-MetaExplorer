  "abstract": "This paper describes a CEFR-based classifier of single-word and multi-word lexical complexity in context from a second language learner perspective in English and in French, developed as an analytical tool for the pedagogical team of the language learning application Mauril. We provide an overview of the required corpora and the way we transformed it into rich contextual representations that allow the disambiguation and accurate labelling in context of polysemous occurrences of a given lexical item. We report evaluation results for all models, including two multi-lingual lexical classifiers evaluated on novel French datasets created for this experiment. Finally, we share the perspective of Maurilâ€™s pedagogical team on the limitations of such systems.",
