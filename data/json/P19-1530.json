  "abstract": "The Penn Treebank (PTB) represents syntactic structures as graphs due to nonlocal dependencies. This paper proposes a method that approximates PTB graph-structured representations by trees. By our approximation method, we can reduce nonlocal dependency identification and constituency parsing into single tree-based parsing. An experimental result demonstrates that our approximation method with an off-the-shelf tree-based constituency parser significantly outperforms the previous methods in nonlocal dependency identification.",
