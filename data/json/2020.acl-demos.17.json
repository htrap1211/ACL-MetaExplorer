  "abstract": "This paper presents LinggleWrite, a writing coach that provides writing suggestions, assesses writing proficiency levels, detects grammatical errors, and offers corrective feedback in response to userâ€™s essay. The method involves extracting grammar patterns, training models for automated essay scoring (AES) and grammatical error detection (GED), and finally retrieving plausible corrections from a n-gram search engine. Experiments on public test sets indicate that both AES and GED models achieve state-of-the-art performance. These results show that LinggleWrite is potentially useful in helping learners improve their writing skills.",
