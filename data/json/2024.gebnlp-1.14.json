  "abstract": "Gender bias has been extensively studied in both the educational field and the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, the former using human coding to identify patterns associated with and causes of gender bias in text and the latter to detect, measure and mitigate gender bias in NLP output and models. This work aims to use NLP to facilitate automatic, quantitative analysis of educational text within the framework of a gender bias taxonomy. Analyses of both educational texts and a lexical resource (WordNet) reveal patterns of bias that can inform and aid educators in updating textbooks and lexical resources and in designing assessment items.",
