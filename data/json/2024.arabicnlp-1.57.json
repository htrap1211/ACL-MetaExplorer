  "abstract": "This paper presents our teamâ€™s contribution to the FIGNEWS 2024 Shared Task, which involved annotating bias and propaganda in news coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict. We developed comprehensive guidelines and employed a rigorous methodology to analyze 2,200 news posts from several official Facebook accounts of news websites in multiple languages. Our team, Narrative Navigators, achieved third place in both the Bias Guidelines and Bias Consistency tracks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We achieved an IAA Kappa score of 39.4 for bias annotation and 12.8 for propaganda detection. These findings and our performance underscore the need for enhanced media literacy and further research to counter the impact of biased and misleading information on public understanding of the conflict.",
