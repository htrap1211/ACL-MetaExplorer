  "abstract": "We present a causal language analysis pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model to identify causal claims made in natural language documents, and aggregates claims across a corpus to produce a causal claim network. The pipeline then applies a clustering algorithm that groups causal claims based on their semantic topics. We demonstrate the pipeline by modeling causal belief systems surrounding the Covid-19 vaccine from tweets.",
