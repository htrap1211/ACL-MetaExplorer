  "abstract": "This submission reports on a three-part series of original methods geared towards producing semantic annotations for the decompositional marker “again”. The three methods are (i) exhaustive expert annotation based on a comprehensive set of guidelines, (ii) extension of expert annotation by predicting presuppositions with a Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier in the context of a meta-analysis to optimize feature selection and (iii) quality-controlled crowdsourcing with ensuing evaluation and KMeans clustering of annotation vectors.",
