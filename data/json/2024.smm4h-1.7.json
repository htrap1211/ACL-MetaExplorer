  "abstract": "In this paper, we have addressed Task 3 on social anxiety disorder identification and Task 5 on mental illness recognition organized by the SMM4H 2024 workshop. In Task 3, a multi-classification problem has been presented to classify Reddit posts about outdoor spaces into four categories: Positive, Neutral, Negative, or Unrelated. Using the pre-trained RoBERTa-base model along with techniques like Mean pooling, CLS, and Attention Head, we have scored an F1-Score of 0.596 on the test dataset for Task 3. Task 5 aims to classify tweets into two categories: those describing a child with conditions like ADHD, ASD, delayed speech, or asthma (class 1), and those merely mentioning a disorder (class 0). Using the pre-trained RoBERTa-large model, incorporating a weighted ensemble of the last 4 hidden layers through concatenation and mean pooling, we achieved an F1 Score of 0.928 on the test data for Task 5.",
