  "abstract": "We introduce unsupervised techniques based on phrase-based statistical machine translation for grammatical error correction (GEC) trained on a pseudo learner corpus created by Google Translation. We verified our GEC system through experiments on a low resource track of the shared task at BEA2019. As a result, we achieved an F0.5 score of 28.31 points with the test data.",
