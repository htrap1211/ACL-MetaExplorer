  "abstract": "This paper describes systems submitted to Se- mEval 2021 Task 1: Lexical Complexity Prediction (LCP). We compare a linear and a non-linear regression models trained to work for both tracks of the task. We show that both systems are able to generalize better when supplied with information about complexities of single word and multi-word expression (MWE) targets simultaneously. This approach proved to be the most beneficial for multi-word expression targets. We also demonstrate that some hand-crafted features differ in their importance for the target types.",
