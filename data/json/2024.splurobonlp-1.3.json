  "abstract": "We constructed a database of Japanese expressions based on route information. Using 20 maps as stimuli, we requested descriptions of routes between two points on each map from 40 individuals per route, collecting 1600 route information reference expressions. We determined whether the expressions were based solely on relative reference expressions by using landmarks on the maps. In cases in which only relative reference expressions were used, we labeled the presence or absence of information regarding the starting point, waypoints, and destination. Additionally, we collected clarity ratings for each expression using a survey.",
