  "abstract": "Generative AI and Large Language Models are increasingly used in business contexts. One application involves natural language conversations contextualized by company data, which can be accomplished by Enterprise Knowledge Graphs, standardized representations of data. This paper outlines an architecture for implementation of an Enterprise Knowledge Graph using open-source Wikibase software. Additionally, it is presented a Knowledge Graph Q&A System powered by Generative AI.",
