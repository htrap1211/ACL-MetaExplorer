  "abstract": "This paper describes our participation in the ArAIEval Shared Task 2024, focusing on Task 2C, which challenges participants to detect propagandistic elements in multimodal Arabic memes. The challenge involves analyzing both the textual and visual components of memes to identify underlying propagandistic messages. Our approach integrates the capabilities of MARBERT and ResNet50, top-performing pre-trained models for text and image processing, respectively. Our system architecture combines these models through a fusion layer that integrates and processes the extracted features, creating a comprehensive representation that is more effective in detecting nuanced propaganda. Our proposed system achieved significant success, placing second with an F1 score of 0.7987.",
