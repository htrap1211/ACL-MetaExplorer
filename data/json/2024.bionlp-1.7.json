  "abstract": "Recent developments in natural language generation have tremendous implications for healthcare. For instance, state-of-the-art systems could automate the generation of sections in clinical reports to alleviate physician workload and streamline hospital documentation. To explore these applications, we present a shared task consisting of two subtasks: (1) Radiology Report Generation (RRG24) and (2) Discharge Summary Generation (“Discharge Me!”). RRG24 involves generating the ‘Findings’ and ‘Impression’ sections of radiology reports given chest X-rays. “Discharge Me!” involves generating the ‘Brief Hospital Course’ and '‘Discharge Instructions’ sections of discharge summaries for patients admitted through the emergency department. “Discharge Me!” submissions were subsequently reviewed by a team of clinicians. Both tasks emphasize the goal of reducing clinician burnout and repetitive workloads by generating documentation. We received 201 submissions from across 8 teams for RRG24, and 211 submissions from across 16 teams for “Discharge Me!”.",
