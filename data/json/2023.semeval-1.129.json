  "abstract": "This paper describes our system used in the SemEval-2023 \\textit{Task 10 Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS)}. Specifically, we participated in subtask B: a 4-class sexism classification task, and subtask C: a more fine-grained (11-class) sexism classification task, where it is necessary to predict the category of sexism. We treat these two subtasks as one multi-label hierarchical text classification problem, and propose an integrated sexism detection model for improving the performance of the sexism detection task. More concretely, we use the pre-trained BERT model to encode the text and class label and a hierarchy-relevant structure encoder is employed to model the relationship between classes of subtasks B and C. Additionally, a self-training strategy is designed to alleviate the imbalanced problem of distribution classes. Extensive experiments on subtasks B and C demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",
