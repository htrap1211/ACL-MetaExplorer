  "abstract": "In supervised learning, a significant amount of data is essential. To achieve this, we generated and evaluated datasets based on a provided dataset using transformer and non-transformer models. By utilizing these generated datasets during the training of new models, we attain a higher balanced accuracy during validation compared to using only the original dataset.",
