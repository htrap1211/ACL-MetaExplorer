This paper focuses on solving NER tasksin a multilingual setting for complex named en-tities. Our team, LLM-RM participated in therecently organized SemEval 2023 task, Task 2:MultiCoNER II,Multilingual Complex NamedEntity Recognition. We approach the problemby leveraging cross-lingual representation pro-vided by fine-tuning XLM-Roberta base modelon datasets of all of the 12 languages provided - Bangla, Chinese, English, Farsi, French,German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish,Swedish and Ukrainian.",
