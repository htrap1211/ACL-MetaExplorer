  "abstract": "Taking note of the current challenges of the peer review system, this paper inventories the research tasks for analysing and possibly automating parts of the reviewing process, like matching submissions with a reviewerâ€™s domain of expertise. For each of these tasks we list their associated datasets, analysing their quality in terms of available documentation of creation and use. Building up on this, we give a set of recommendations to take into account when collecting and releasing data.",
