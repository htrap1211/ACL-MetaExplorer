  "abstract": "This study investigates learning with disagreement in NLP tasks and evaluates its performance on four datasets. The results suggest that the model performs best on the experimental dataset and faces challenges in minority languages. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that annotator demographics play a significant role in the interpretation of such tasks. This study suggests the need for greater consideration of demographic differences in annotators and more comprehensive evaluation metrics for NLP models.",
