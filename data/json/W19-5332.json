  "abstract": "In this paper we describe our joint submission (JU-Saarland) from Jadavpur University and Saarland University in the WMT 2019 news translation shared task for English–Gujarati language pair within the translation task sub-track. Our baseline and primary submissions are built using Recurrent neural network (RNN) based neural machine translation (NMT) system which follows attention mechanism. Given the fact that the two languages belong to different language families and there is not enough parallel data for this language pair, building a high quality NMT system for this language pair is a difficult task. We produced synthetic data through back-translation from available monolingual data. We report the translation quality of our English–Gujarati and Gujarati–English NMT systems trained at word, byte-pair and character encoding levels where RNN at word level is considered as the baseline and used for comparison purpose. Our English–Gujarati system ranked in the second position in the shared task.",
