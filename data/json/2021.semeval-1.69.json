  "abstract": "This paper describes the CompNa model that has been submitted to the Lexical Complexity Prediction (LCP) shared task hosted at SemEval 2021 (Task 1). The solution is based on combining features of different nature through an ensambling method based on Decision Trees and trained using Gradient Boosting. We discuss the results of the model and highlight the features with more predictive capabilities.",
