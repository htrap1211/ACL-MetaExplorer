  "abstract": "Identifying human values behind arguments isa complex task which requires understandingof premise, stance and conclusion together. Wepropose a method that uses a pre-trained lan-guage model, DeBERTa, to tokenize and con-catenate the text before feeding it into a fullyconnected neural network. We also show thatleveraging the hierarchy in values improves theperformance by .14 F1 score.",
