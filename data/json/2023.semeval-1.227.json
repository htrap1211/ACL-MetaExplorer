  "abstract": "We describe our submission to SemEval 2023 Task 3, specifically the subtask on persuasion technique detection. In this work, our team NLUBot101 tackled a novel task of classifying persuasion techniques in online news articles at a paragraph level. The low-resource multilingual datasets, along with the imbalanced label distribution, make this task challenging. Our team presented a cross-lingual data augmentation approach and leveraged a recently proposed multilingual natural language inference model to address these challenges. Our solution achieves the highest macro-F1 score for the English task, and top 5 micro-F1 scores on both the English and Russian leaderboards.",
