  "abstract": "Humor recognition is a challenging task in natural language processing. This document presents my approaches to detect and rate humor and offense from the given text. This task includes 2 tasks: task 1 which contains 3 subtasks (1a, 1b, and 1c), and task 2. Subtask 1a and 1c can be regarded as classification problems and take ALBERT as the basic model. Subtask 1b and 2 can be viewed as regression issues and take RoBERTa as the basic model.",
