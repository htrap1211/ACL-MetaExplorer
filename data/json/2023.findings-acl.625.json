  "abstract": "The size of embeddings generated by large language models can negatively affect system latency and model size in certain downstream practical applications (e.g. KNN search). In this work, we propose EmbedTextNet, a light add-on network that can be appended to an arbitrary language model to generate a compact embedding without requiring any changes in its architecture or training procedure. Specifically, we use a correlation penalty added to the weighted reconstruction loss that better captures the informative features in the text embeddings, which improves the efficiency of the language models. We evaluated EmbedTextNet on three different downstream tasks: text similarity, language modelling, and text retrieval. Empirical results on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of EmbedTextNet compared to state-of-art methodologies in recent works, especially in extremely low dimensional embedding sizes. The developed code for reproducibility is included in the supplementary material.",
