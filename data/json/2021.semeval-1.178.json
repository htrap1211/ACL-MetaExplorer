  "abstract": "This work describes our approach for subtasks of SemEval-2021 Task 8: MeasEval: Counts and Measurements which took the official first place in the competition. To solve all subtasks we use multi-task learning in a question-answering-like manner. We also use learnable scalar weights to weight subtasksâ€™ contribution to the final loss in multi-task training. We fine-tune LUKE to extract quantity spans and we fine-tune RoBERTa to extract everything related to found quantities, including quantities themselves.",
