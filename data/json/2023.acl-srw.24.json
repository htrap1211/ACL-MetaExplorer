  "abstract": "While embedding-based methods have been dominant in language clustering for multilingual tasks, clustering based on linguistic features has not yet been explored much, as it remains baselines (Tan et al., 2019; Shaffer, 2021). This study investigates whether and how theoretical linguistics improves language clustering for multilingual named entity recognition (NER). We propose two types of language groupings: one based on morpho-syntactic features in a nominal domain and one based on a head parameter. Our NER experiments show that the proposed methods largely outperform a state-of-the-art embedding-based model, suggesting that theoretical linguistics plays a significant role in multilingual learning tasks.",
