  "abstract": "Despite being spoken by a large population of speakers worldwide, Cantonese is under-resourced in terms of the data scale and diversity compared to other major languages. This limitation has excluded it from the current “pre-training and fine-tuning” paradigm that is dominated by Transformer architectures.In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review on the existing resources and methodologies for Cantonese Natural Language Processing, covering the recent progress in language understanding, text generation and development of language models.We finally discuss two aspects of the Cantonese language that could make it potentially challenging even for state-of-the-art architectures:colloquialismandmultilinguality.",
