  "abstract": "This paper presents our approach to the SemEval-2023 Task 3 to detect online persuasion techniques in a multilingual setup. Our classification system is based on the RoBERTa-base model trained predominantly on English to label the persuasion techniques across 9 different languages. Our system was able to significantly surpass the baseline performance in 3 of the 9 languages: English, Georgian and Greek. However, our wrong assumption that a single classification system trained predominantly on English could generalize well to other languages, negatively impacted our scores on the other 6 languages. In this paper, we provide a description of the reasoning behind the development of our final model and what conclusions may be drawn from its performance for future work.",
