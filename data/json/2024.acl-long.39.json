  "abstract": "Medical text generation aims to assist with administrative work and highlight salient information to support decision-making.To reflect the specific requirements of medical text, in this paper, we propose a set of metrics to evaluate the completeness, conciseness, and attribution of the generated text at a fine-grained level. The metrics can be computed by various types of evaluators including instruction-following (both proprietary and open-source) and supervised entailment models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting framework, DocLens, with three evaluators on three tasks: clinical note generation, radiology report summarization, and patient question summarization. A comprehensive human study shows that DocLens exhibits substantially higher agreement with the judgments of medical experts than existing metrics. The results also highlight the need to improve open-source evaluators and suggest potential directions. We released the code at https://github.com/yiqingxyq/DocLens.",
