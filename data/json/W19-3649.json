  "abstract": "In recent years, studies of authorship recognition has aroused great interest in graph-based analysis. Modeling the writing style of each author using a network of co-occurrence words. However, short texts can generate some changes in the topology of network that cause impact on techniques of feature extraction based on graph topology. In this work, we evaluate the robustness of global-strategy and local-strategy based on complex network measurements comparing with graph2vec a graph embedding technique based on skip-gram model. The experiment consists of evaluating how each modification in the length of text affects the accuracy of authorship recognition on both techniques using cross-validation and machine learning techniques.",
