  "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a free/open-source finite-state morphologicaltransducer for Highland Puebla Nahuatl, a Uto-Aztecan language spoken in and around the stateof Puebla in Mexico. The finite-state toolkit used for the work is the Helsinki Finite-StateToolkit (HFST); we use the lexc formalism for modelling the morphotactics and twol formal-ism for modelling morphophonological alternations. An evaluation is presented which showsthat the transducer has a reasonable coveragearound 90%on freely-available corpora of the language, and high precisionover 95%on a manually verified test set",
