  "abstract": "Semantic hashing has become a powerful paradigm for fast similarity search in many information retrieval systems. While fairly successful, previous techniques generally require two-stage training, and the binary constraints are handledad-hoc. In this paper, we present anend-to-endNeural Architecture for Semantic Hashing (NASH), where the binary hashing codes are treated asBernoullilatent variables. A neural variational inference framework is proposed for training, where gradients are directly backpropagated through the discrete latent variable to optimize the hash function. We also draw the connections between proposed method andrate-distortion theory, which provides a theoretical foundation for the effectiveness of our framework. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models on bothunsupervisedandsupervisedscenarios.",
