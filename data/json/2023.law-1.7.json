  "abstract": "This work presents two corpora based on excerpts from two novels with an informal narration style in German. We performed fine-grained multi-layer annotations of animate referents, assigning local and global prominence-lending features to the annotated referring expressions. In addition, our corpora include annotations of intra-sentential segments, which can serve as a more reliable unit of length measurement. Furthermore, we present two exemplary studies demonstrating how to use these corpora.",
