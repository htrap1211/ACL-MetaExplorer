  "abstract": "The development of language technology (LT) for an endangered language is often identified as a goal in language revitalization efforts, but developing such technologies is typically subject to additional methodological challenges as well as social and ethical concerns. In particular, LT development has too often taken on colonialist qualities, extracting language data, relying on outside experts, and denying the speakers of a language sovereignty over the technologies produced.We seek to avoid such an approach through the development of the Building Endangered Language Technology (BELT) website, an educational resource designed for speakers and community members with limited technological experience to develop LTs for their own language. Specifically, BELT provides interactive lessons on basic Python programming, coupled with projects to develop specific language technologies, such as spellcheckers or word games. In this paper, we describe BELTâ€™s design, the motivation underlying many key decisions, and preliminary responses from learners.",
