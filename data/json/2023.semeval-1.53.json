  "abstract": "This paper describes our system submitted for SemEval Task 7, Multi-Evidence Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trial Data. The task consists of 2 subtasks. Subtask 1 is to determine the relationships between clinical trial data (CTR) and statements. Subtask 2 is to output a set of supporting facts extracted from the premises with the input of CTR premises and statements. Through experiments, we found that our GPT2-based pre-trained models can obtain good results in Subtask 2. Therefore, we use the GPT2-based pre-trained model to fine-tune Subtask 2. We transform the evidence retrieval task into a binary class task by combining premises and statements as input, and the output is whether the premises and statements match. We obtain a top-5 score in the evaluation phase of Subtask 2.",
