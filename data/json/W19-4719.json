  "abstract": "This study investigates the mutual effects over time of semantically related function words on each otherâ€™s distribution over syntactic environments. Words that can have the same meaning are observed to have opposite trends of change in frequency across different syntactic structures which correspond to the shared meaning. This phenomenon is demonstrated to have a rational basis: it increases communicative efficiency by prioritizing words differently in the environments on which they compete.",
