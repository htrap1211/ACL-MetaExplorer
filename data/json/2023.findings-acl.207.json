  "abstract": "With a growing focus on morphological inflection systems for languages where high-quality data is scarce, training data noise is a serious but so far largely ignored concern. We aim at closing this gap by investigating the types of noise encountered within a pipeline for truly unsupervised morphological paradigm completion and its impact on morphological inflection systems: First, we propose an error taxonomy and annotation pipeline for inflection training data. Then, we compare the effect of different types of noise on multiple state-of-the- art inflection models. Finally, we propose a novel character-level masked language modeling (CMLM) pretraining objective and explore its impact on the modelsâ€™ resistance to noise. Our experiments show that various architectures are impacted differently by separate types of noise, but encoder-decoders tend to be more robust to noise than models trained with a copy bias. CMLM pretraining helps transformers, but has lower impact on LSTMs.",
