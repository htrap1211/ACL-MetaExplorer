  "abstract": "Sentiment analysis (SA) is one of the most useful natural language processing applications. Literature is flooding with many papers and systems addressing this task, but most of the work is focused on English. In this paper, we present “Mazajak”, an online system for Arabic SA. The system is based on a deep learning model, which achieves state-of-the-art results on many Arabic dialect datasets including SemEval 2017 and ASTD. The availability of such system should assist various applications and research that rely on sentiment analysis as a tool.",
