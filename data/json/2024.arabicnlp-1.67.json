  "abstract": "This paper introduces the methodology of BSC-LANGTECH team for the FIGNEWS 2024 Shared Task on News Media Narratives. Following the bias annotation subtask, we apply the theory and methods of framing analysis to develop guidelines to annotate bias in the corpus provided by the task organizators. The manual annotation of a subset, with which a moderate IAA agreement has been achieved, is further used in Deep Learning techniques to explore automatic annotation and test the reliability of our framework.",
