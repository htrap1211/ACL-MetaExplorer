  "abstract": "This paper describes our approach for Subtask 1 of Task 3 at SemEval-2023. In this subtask, task participants were asked to classify multilingual news articles for one of three classes: Reporting, Opinion Piece or Satire. By training an AdapterFusion layer composing the task-adapters from different languages, we successfully combine the language-exclusive knowledge and show that this improves the results in nearly all cases, including in zero-shot scenarios.",
