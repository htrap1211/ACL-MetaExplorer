  "abstract": "Disambiguating a wordâ€™s intended meaning(sense) in a given context is important in Nat-ural Language Understanding (NLU). WSDaims to determine the correct sense of ambigu-ous words in context. At the same time, LMD(a WSD variation) focuses on disambiguatinglocation mention. Both tasks are vital in Nat-ural Language Processing (NLP) and informa-tion retrieval, as they help correctly interpretand extract information from text. Arabic ver-sion is further challenging because of its mor-phological richness, encompassing a complexinterplay of roots, stems, and affixes. This pa-per describes our solutions to both tasks, em-ploying Llama3 and Cohere-based models un-der Zero-Shot Learning and Re-Ranking, re-spectively. Both the shared tasks were partof the second Arabic Natural Language Pro-cessing Conference co-located with ACL 2024.Overall, we achieved 1st rank in the WSD task(accuracy 78%) and 2nd rank in the LMD task(MRR@1 0.59)",
