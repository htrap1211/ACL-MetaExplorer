  "abstract": "In this paper, we present our methodology and findings from participating in the FIGNEWS 2024 shared task on annotating news fragments on the Gaza-Israel war for bias and propaganda detection. The task aimed to refine the FIGNEWS 2024 annotation guidelines and to contribute to the creation of a comprehensive dataset to advance research in this field. Our team employed a multi-faceted approach to ensure high accuracy in data annotations. Our results highlight key challenges in detecting bias and propaganda, such as the need for more comprehensive guidelines. Our team ranked first in all tracks for propaganda annotation. For Bias, the team stood in first place for the Guidelines and IAA tracks, and in second place for the Quantity and Consistency tracks.",
