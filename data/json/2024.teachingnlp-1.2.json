  "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a fast-paced field and a popular course topic in many undergraduate and graduate programs. This paper presents a comprehensive suite of example-driven course slides covering NLP concepts, ranging from fundamental building blocks to modern state-of-the-art approaches. In contributing these slides, I hope to alleviate burden for those starting out as faculty or in need of course material updates. The slides are publicly available for external use and are updated regularly to incorporate new advancements.",
