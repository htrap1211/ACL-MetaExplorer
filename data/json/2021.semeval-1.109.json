  "abstract": "This paper describes the winning system for subtask 2 and the second-placed system for subtask 1 in SemEval 2021 Task 4: ReadingComprehension of Abstract Meaning. We propose to use pre-trianed Electra discriminator to choose the best abstract word from five candidates. An upper attention and auto denoising mechanism is introduced to process the long sequences. The experiment results demonstrate that this contribution greatly facilitatesthe contextual language modeling in reading comprehension task. The ablation study is also conducted to show the validity of our proposed methods.",
