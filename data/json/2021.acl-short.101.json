  "abstract": "According to the self-determination theory, the levels of satisfaction of three basic needs (competence, autonomy and relatedness) have implications on peopleâ€™s everyday life and career. We benchmark the novel task of automatically detecting those needs on short posts in English, by modelling it as a ternary classification task, and as three binary classification tasks. A detailed manual analysis shows that the latter has advantages in the real-world scenario, and that our best models achieve similar performances as a trained human annotator.",
