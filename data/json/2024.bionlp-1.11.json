  "abstract": "As the number of scientific publications is growing at a rapid pace, it is difficult for laypeople to keep track of and understand the latest scientific advances, especially in the biomedical domain. While the summarization of scientific publications has been widely studied, research on summarization targeting laypeople has remained scarce. In this study, considering the lengthy input of biomedical articles, we have developed a lay summarization system through an extract-then-summarize framework with large language models (LLMs) to summarize biomedical articles for laypeople. Using a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model, our approach achieves the highest overall ranking and demonstrates the best relevance performance in the BioLaySumm 2024 shared task.",
