  "abstract": "There are publicly available general purpose sentiment lexicons in some high resource languages but very few exist in the low resource languages. This makes it difficult to directly perform sentiment analysis tasks in such languages. The objective of this work is to create a general purpose sentiment lexicon for Igbo language that can determine the sentiment of documents written in Igbo language without having to translate it to English language. The material used was an automatically translated Liu’s lexicon and manual addition of Igbo native words. The result of this work is a general purpose lexicon – IgboSentilex. The performance was tested on the BBC Igbo news channel. It returned an average polarity agreement of 95% with other general purpose sentiment lexicons.",
