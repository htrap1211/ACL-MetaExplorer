  "abstract": "Text classification with extremely weak supervision (EWS) imposes stricter supervision constraints compared to regular weakly supervise classification. Absolutely no labeled training samples or hand-crafted rules specific to the evaluation data are allowed. Such restrictions limit state-of-the-art EWS classification methods to indirect weak labeling techniques that assign unnatural label uncertainty estimates. We present PLAT, a framework that creates weak labels by leveraging recent developments in zero-shot text classification. PLAT employs models trained for sub-tasks other than classification to label documents. Most importantly, PLAT refrains from assigning overly confident weak labels and improves soft-label training performance for downstream classifiers. Classifiers trained with PLAT significantly outperform those trained on weak labels generated by the previous state-of-the-art in extremely weakly supervised text classification.",
