  "abstract": "Adversarial attacks reveal serious flaws in deep learning models. More dangerously, these attacks preserve the original meaning and escape human recognition. Existing methods for detecting these attacks need to be trained using original/adversarial data. In this paper, we propose detection without training by voting on hard labels from predictions of transformations, namely, VoteTRANS. Specifically, VoteTRANS detects adversarial text by comparing the hard labels of input text and its transformation. The evaluation demonstrates that VoteTRANS effectively detects adversarial text across various state-of-the-art attacks, models, and datasets.",
