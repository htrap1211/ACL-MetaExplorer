  "abstract": "We present a monolingual alignment system for long, sentence- or clause-level alignments, and demonstrate that systems designed for word- or short phrase-based alignment are ill-suited for these longer alignments. Our system is capable of aligning semantically similar spans of arbitrary length. We achieve significantly higher recall on aligning phrases of four or more words and outperform state-of-the- art aligners on the long alignments in the MSR RTE corpus.",
