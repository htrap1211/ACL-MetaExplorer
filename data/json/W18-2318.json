  "abstract": "A search that is targeted at finding a specific document in databases is called a Single Citation search. Single citation searches are particularly important for scholarly databases, such as PubMed, because users are frequently searching for a specific publication. In this work we describe SingleCite, a single citation matching system designed to facilitate userâ€™s search for a specific document. We report on the progress that has been achieved towards building that functionality.",
