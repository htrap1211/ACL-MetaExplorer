  "abstract": "This paper presents our proposed method for english documents genre classification in the context of SemEval 2023 task 3, subtask 1. Our method use ensemble technique to combine four distinct models predictions: Longformer, RoBERTa, GCN, and a sentences number-based model. Each model is optimized on simple objectives and easy to grasp. We provide snippets of code that define each model to make the reading experience better. Our method ranked 12th in documents genre classification for english texts.",
