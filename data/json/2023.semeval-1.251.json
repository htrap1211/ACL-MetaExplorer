  "abstract": "Online articles using striking headlines that promise intriguing information are often used to attract readers. Most of the time, the information provided in the text is disappointing to the reader after the headline promised exciting news. As part of the SemEval-2023 challenge, we propose a system to generate a spoiler for these headlines. The spoiler provides the information promised by the headline and eliminates the need to read the full article. We consider Multi-Task Learning and generating more data using a distillation approach in our system. With this, we achieve an F1 score up to 51.48% on extracting the spoiler from the articles.",
