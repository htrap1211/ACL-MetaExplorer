  "abstract": "This paper outlines our submission for the IWSLT 2024 Simultaneous Speech-to-Text (SimulS2T) and Speech-to-Speech (SimulS2S) Translation competition. We have engaged in all four language directions and both the SimulS2T and SimulS2S tracks: English-German (EN-DE), English-Chinese (EN-ZH), English-Japanese (EN-JA), and Czech-English (CS-EN). For the S2T track, we have built upon our previous year’s system and further honed the cascade system composed of ASR model and MT model. Concurrently, we have introduced an end-to-end system specifically for the CS-EN direction. This end-to-end (E2E) system primarily employs the pre-trained seamlessM4T model. In relation to the SimulS2S track, we have integrated a novel TTS model into our SimulS2T system. The final submission for the S2T directions of EN-DE, EN-ZH, and EN-JA has been refined over our championship system from last year. Building upon this foundation, the incorporation of the new TTS into our SimulS2S system has resulted in the ASR-BLEU surpassing last year’s best score.",
