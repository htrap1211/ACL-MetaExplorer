  "abstract": "We present a simple NLP methodology for detecting COVID-19 misinformation videos on YouTube by leveraging user comments. We use transfer learning pre-trained models to generate a multi-label classifier that can categorize conspiratorial content. We use the percentage of misinformation comments on each video as a new feature for video classification.",
