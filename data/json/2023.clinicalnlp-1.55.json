  "abstract": "Summarizing medical conversations is one of the tasks proposed by MEDIQA-Chat to promote research on automatic clinical note generation from doctor-patient conversations. In this paper, we present our submission to this task using fine-tuned language models, including T5, BART and BioGPT models. The fine-tuned models are evaluated using ensemble metrics including ROUGE, BERTScore andBLEURT. Among the fine-tuned models, Flan-T5 achieved the highest aggregated score for dialogue summarization.",
