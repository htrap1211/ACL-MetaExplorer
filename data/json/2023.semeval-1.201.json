  "abstract": "Successful word sense disambiguation (WSD)is a fundamental element of natural languageunderstanding. As part of SemEval-2023 Task1, we investigate WSD in a multimodal setting,where ambiguous words are to be matched withcandidate images representing word senses. Wecompare multiple systems based on pre-trainedCLIP models. In our experiments, we findCLIP to have solid zero-shot performance onmonolingual and multilingual data. By em-ploying different fine-tuning techniques, we areable to further enhance performance. However,transferring knowledge between data distribu-tions proves to be more challenging.",
