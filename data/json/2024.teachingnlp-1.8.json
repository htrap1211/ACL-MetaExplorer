  "abstract": "In natural language processing courses, students often struggle to debug their code. In this paper, we present three homework assignments that are tightly coupled with in-class worksheets. The worksheets allow students to confirm their understanding of the algorithms on paper before trying to write code. Then, as students complete the coding portion of the assignments, the worksheets aid students in the debugging process as test cases for the code, allowing students to seamlessly compare their results to those from the correct execution of the algorithm.",
