  "abstract": "This paper describes the HEVS-TUW team submission to the SemEval-2023 Task 8: Causal Claims. We participated in two subtasks: (1) causal claims detection and (2) PIO identification. For subtask 1, we experimented with an ensemble of weakly supervised question detection and fine-tuned Transformer-based models. For subtask 2 of PIO frame extraction, we used a combination of deep representation learning and a rule-based approach. Our best model for subtask 1 ranks fourth with an F1-score of 65.77%. It shows moderate benefit from ensembling models pre-trained on independent categories. The results for subtask 2 warrant further investigation for improvement.",
