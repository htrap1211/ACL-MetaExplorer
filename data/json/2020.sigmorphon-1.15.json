  "abstract": "The objective of this shared task is to produce an inflected form of a word, given its lemma and a set of tags describing the attributes of the desired form. In this paper, we describe a transformer-based model that uses a bidirectional decoder to perform this task, and evaluate its performance on the 90 languages and 18 language families used in this task.",
