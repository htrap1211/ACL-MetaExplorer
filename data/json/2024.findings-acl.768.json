  "abstract": "We investigate ways of using monolingual data in both the source and target languages for improving low-resource machine translation. As a case study, we experiment with translation from Finnish to Northern SÃ¡mi.Our experiments show that while conventional backtranslation remains a strong contender, using synthetic target-side data when training backtranslation models can be helpful as well.We also show that monolingual data can be used to train a language model which can act as a regularizer without any augmentation of parallel data.",
