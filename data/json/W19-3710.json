  "abstract": "This paper describes the Cognitive Computation (CogComp) Groupâ€™s submissions to the multilingual named entity recognition shared task at the Balto-Slavic Natural Language Processing (BSNLP) Workshop. The final model submitted is a multi-source neural NER system with multilingual BERT embeddings, trained on the concatenation of training data in various Slavic languages (as well as English). The performance of our system on the official testing data suggests that multi-source approaches consistently outperform single-source approaches for this task, even with the noise of mismatching tagsets.",
