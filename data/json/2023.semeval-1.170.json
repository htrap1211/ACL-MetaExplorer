  "abstract": "This work presents the approach developed by the DUTH team for participating in the SemEval-2023 Task 9: Multilingual Tweet Intimacy Analysis. Our results show that pre-processing techniques do not affect the learning performance for the task of multilingual intimacy analysis. In addition, we show that fine-tuning a transformer-based model does not provide advantages over using the pre-trained model to generate text embeddings and using the resulting representations to train simpler and more efficient models such as MLP. Finally, we utilize an ensemble of classifiers, including three MLPs with different architectures and a CatBoost model, to improve the regression accuracy.",
