  "abstract": "IXA proposes a Sequence labeling fine-tune approach, which consists of a lightweight few-shot baseline (10e), the system takes advantage of transfer learning from pre-trained Named Entity Recognition and cross-lingual knowledge from the LM checkpoint. This technique obtains a drastic reduction in the effective training costs that works as a perfect baseline, future improvements in the baseline approach could fit: 1) Domain adequation, 2) Data augmentation, and 3) Intermediate task learning.",
