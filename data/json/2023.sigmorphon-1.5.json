  "abstract": "UniMorphâ€“the Universal Morphology project is a collaborative initiative to create and maintain morphological data and organize numerous related tasks for various language processing communities. The morphological data is provided by linguists for over 160 languages in the latest version of UniMorph 4.0. This paper sheds light on the Central Kurdish data on UniMorph 4.0 by analyzing the existing data, its fallacies, and systematic morphological errors. It also presents an approach to creating more reliable morphological data by considering various specific phenomena in Central Kurdish that have not been addressed previously, such as Izafe and several enclitics.",
