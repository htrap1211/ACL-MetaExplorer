  "abstract": "In recent years, the use of synthetic data, either as a complement or a substitute for original data, has emerged as a solution to challenges such as data scarcity and security risks. This paper is an initial attempt to automatically generate such data for Information Extraction tasks. We accomplished this by developing a novel synthetic data generation framework called KGAST, which leverages Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models. In our preliminary study, we conducted simple experiments to generate synthetic versions of two datasets—a French security defense dataset and an English general domain dataset, after which we evaluated them both intrinsically and extrinsically. The results indicated that synthetic data can effectively complement original data, improving the performance of models on classes with limited training samples. This highlights KGAST’s potential as a tool for generating synthetic data for Information Extraction tasks.",
